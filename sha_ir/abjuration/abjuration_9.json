    "description": "When you cast imprisonment and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the temporal stasis spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The subject remains there unless a freedom spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a crystal ball, a locate object spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but discern location does. A wish or miracle spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a -4 penalty on its save. ",

    "description": "This spell functions like prismatic wall, except you conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light that surrounds you and protects you from all forms of attack. The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum. \nThe sphere's blindness effect on creatures with less than 8 HD lasts 2d4Ã—10 minutes. \nYou can pass into and out of the prismatic sphere and remain near it without harm.  However, when you're inside it, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere (including spells).  Other creatures that attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time. \nTypically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe will exist, since you are at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually excluded by the floor surface you are standing on. \nThe colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a prismatic wall. \nPrismatic sphere can be made permanent with a permanency spell. \n\n\nColor \nOrder \nEffect of Color \nNegated By \n\n\n Red \n 1st \n Stops nonmagical ranged weapons.  \n Cone of cold \n\n\n \n \n Deals 20 points of fire damage (Relfex half).  \n \n\n\n Orange \n 2nd \n Stops magical ranged weapons.  \n Gust of wind \n\n\n \n \n Deals 40 points of acid damage (Reflex half).  \n \n\n\n Yellow \n 3rd \n Stops poisons, gases and petrification.  \n Disintegrate \n\n\n \n \n Deals 80 points of electricity damage (Reflex half).  \n \n\n\n Green \n 4th \n Stops breath weapons \n Passwall \n\n\n \n \n Poison (Kills; Fortitude partial for 1d6 points of Con damage instead).  \n \n\n\n Blue \n 5th \n Stops divination and mental attacks.  \n Magic missle \n\n\n \n \n Turned to stone (Fortitude negates).  \n \n\n\n Indigo \n 6th \n Stops all spells.  \n Daylight \n\n\n \n \n Will save or become insane (as insanity spell).  \n \n\n\n Violet \n 7th \n Energy field destroys all objects and effects.  \n Dispel magic \n\n\n \n \n Creatures sent to another plane (Will negates).  \n \n\n\nNote: The violet effect makes the special effects of the other six colors redundant, but these six effects are included here because certain magic items can create prismatic effects one color at a time, and spell resistance might render some colors ineffective (see above).

    "description": "All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a dispel magic spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's Will save bonus, whichever is higher. You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an antimagic field. If the antimagic field survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined. Even artifacts are subject to disjunction, though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. (These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even miracle or wish). Note: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device. ",
