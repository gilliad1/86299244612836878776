    "description": "You discern all spells and magical properties present in a number of creatures or objects.  Each round, you may examine a single creature or object that you can see as a free action.  In the case of a magic item, you learn its functions, how to activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if it uses charges).  In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level. \nAn attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires.  If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it.  An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other analyze dweomer spells for 24 hours. \nAnalyze dweomer does not function when used on an artifact (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on artifacts). \nFocus: A tiny lens of ruby or sapphire set in a small golden loop.  The gemstone must be worth at least 1,500 gp. ",

    "description": "You confer on the subject the ability to see all things as they actually are.  The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement effects, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things.  Further, the subject can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces).  The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet. \nTrue seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects.  It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent.  It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like.  True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means.  In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairaudience/clairvoyance. \nMaterial Component: An ointment for the eyes that costs 250 gp and is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat.

    "description": "Legend lore brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4Ã—10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are \"legendary\", as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds. Examples of legend lore results include the following. A divination about a mysterious magic axe you have at hand: \"Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft chops the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Son or Daughter of Stone, one who loves Moradin and whom Moradin loves, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word 'Rudnogg'on the lips\". A divination about a legendary paladin about whom you know many details: \"Vanashon has been denied the glory of death and the duty of life. He waits patiently beneath the Forbidden Mountain\". (The paladin has been turned to stone in the caverns under the mountain). A divination about ancient ruins about which you have only a passing reference in a partially damaged tome: \"The sorcerer who called herself Ryth built a library without words and a temple without gods. Those who read and those who pray tore it down in a night and a day\". (These clues may be enough for you to find out more and get details you need to cast a better legend lore). Material Component: Incense worth at least 250 gp. Focus: Four strips of ivory (worth 50 gp each) formed into a rectangle. ",
