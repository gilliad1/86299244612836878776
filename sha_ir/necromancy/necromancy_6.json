    "description": "A much more potent spell than animate dead, this evil spell allows you to create more powerful sorts of undead: ghouls, ghasts, mummies, and mohrgs (see the Monster Manual for more information on all types of undead).  The type or types of undead you can create is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below. \n\n\nCaster Level \nUndead Created \n\n\n 11th or lower \n Ghoul \n\n\n 12th-14th \n Ghast \n\n\n 15th-17th \n Mummy \n\n\n 18th or higher \n Mohrg\n\n\nYou may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose.  For example, at 16th level you could decide to create a ghoul or a ghast instead of a mummy.  Doing this may be a good idea, because created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator.  If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms (see Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159). \nThis spell must be cast at night. \nMaterial Component: A clay pot filled with grave dirt and another filled with brackish water.  The spell must be cast on a dead body.  You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the undead to be created into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse.  The magic of the spell turns these gems into worthless shells. ",

A sickened creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.  A creature affected by this spell remains sickened for 10 minutes per caster level.  The effects cannot be negated by a remove disease or heal spell, but a remove curse is effective. \nPanicked: The subject becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds.  Even after the panic ends, the creature remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes panicked again if it comes within sight of you during that time.  This is a fear effect. \nComatose: The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level.  During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect.  This is not a sleep effect, and thus elves are not immune to it. \nThe spell lasts for 1 round per three caster levels.  You must spend a move action each round after the first to target a foe. ",
