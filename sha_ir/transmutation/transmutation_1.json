    "description": "The affected creatures or objects fall slowly, though faster than feathers typically do. Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of afall froma few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes. The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth. You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell when it isn't your turn. This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, such as a boulder dropped from the top of a castle wall, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop. (See the Dungeon Master's Guide for information on falling objects). Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature. ",

Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%. Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. (A natural 1 or 2 is always a failure on this check).

Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction of the rope's diameter by half. \nThe possible commands are \"coil\" (form a neat, coiled stack), \"coil and knot\", \"loop\", \"loop and knot\", \"tie and knot\", and the opposites of all of the above (\"uncoil\", and so forth).  You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell. \nThe rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it—it does not snake outward—so it must be thrown near the intended target.  Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet).  A typical 1-inchdiameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it.  The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled.  A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell.  An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check. \nThe rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical. \nThis spell grants a +2 bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using the transmuted rope. \nThe spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.

    "description": "This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature's size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size. A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target's speed. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it—the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage (see Table 2-2 in the Dungeon Master's Guide). Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell—an enlarged +1 sword still has only a +1 enhancement bonus, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, and so on. Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of a humanoid that's still under the effect of the first casting. Enlarge person counters and dispels reduce person. Enlarge person can be made permanent with a permanency spell. Material Component: A pinch of powdered iron. ",
