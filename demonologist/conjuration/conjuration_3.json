In exchange, they will serve the caster for one year as guards, slaves, or whatever else she needs them for. They are profoundly stupid, so the caster cannot give them more complicated tasks than can be described in about ten words. No matter how many times the caster casts this spell, she can control no more than 2 HD worth of fiends per caster level. If she exceeds this number, all the newly called creatures fall under the caster's control, and any excess from previous castings become uncontrolled. The caster chooses which creatures to release.
