    "description": "You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity.  You may select from the following options. \nApproach: On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round.  The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal. \nDrop: On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding.  It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn. \nFall: On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 1 round.  It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties. \nFlee: On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round.  It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal. \nHalt: The subject stands in place for 1 round.  It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless.  \nIf the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails. ",
