    "description": "At your touch, the weapon seems to disappear from view. You enable someone to hide a weapon on his person. The weapon does not become truly invisible so much as easily overlooked. Secret weapon adds +20 to the Sleight of Hand check to conceal a light weapon, and +10 to the check to conceal a larger weapon (even one normally too large to conceal). A \"weapon\" is defined as any manufactured weapon. With the aid of this spell, you can attempt to hide a weapon even if you do not possess the Sleight of Hand skill. Additionally, you can hide the presence of a weapon from detection spells, although true seeing penetrates the glamer. Material Component: A thin black cloth. ",
