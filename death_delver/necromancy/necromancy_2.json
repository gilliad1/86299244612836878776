    "description": "This spell allows you to wrap a single target in death's embrace, making him both feel and appear dead for the duration of the spell. You must be able to touch the target, and the target must have a Wisdom score, but otherwise the spell can affect any creature, including intelligent undead. You must succeed on a melee touch attack to affect unwilling targets, and those who fail their saving throws immediately fall to the ground as though dead. All vital functions (if any) are suspended; subjects of this spell do not breathe, pump blood, or otherwise indicate in any way that they still live. Any physical harm done to someone in this state immediately grants another saving throw to awaken from the artificial torpor. Material Component: A pinch of ash from a cremated body of any kind. ",
