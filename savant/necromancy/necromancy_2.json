Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes transporting a fallen comrade more pleasant. The spell also works on severed body parts and the like. Arcane Material Component: A pinch of salt, and a copper piece for each eye the corpse has (or had). ",
