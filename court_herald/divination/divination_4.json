    "description": "This spell functions like locate object, except this spell locates a known or familiar creature. You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within range. You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any. The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn) or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of a certain type (such as humanoid or animal). To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once. Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by mislead, nondetection, and polymorph spells. Material Component: A bit of fur from a bloodhound. ",

    "description": "You can see and hear some creature, which may be at any distance.  If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the scrying attempt simply fails.  The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.  Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save. \n\n\nKnowledge \nWill Save Modifier \n\n\n None 1 \n +10 \n\n\n Secondhand (you have heard of the subject) \n +5 \n\n\n Firsthand (you have met the subject) \n +0 \n\n\n Familiar (you know the subject well) \n —5 \n\n\n1 You must have some sort of connection to a creature you have no knowledge of.  \n\n\nConnection \nWill Save Modifier \n\n\n Likeness or picture \n —2 \n\n\n Possession or garment \n —4 \n\n\n Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc.  \n —10 \n\n\nIf the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and the subject's immediate surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject).  If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet. \nAs with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects.  In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, and message.  \nIf the save succeeds, you can't attempt to scry on that subject again for at least 24 hours. \nArcane Material Component: The eye of a hawk, an eagle, or a roc, plus nitric acid, copper, and zinc. \nWizard, Sorcerer, or Bard Focus: A mirror of finely wrought and highly polished silver costing not less than 1,000 gp.  The mirror must be at least 2 feet by 4 feet. \nCleric Focus: A holy water font costing not less than 100 gp. \nDruid Focus: A natural pool of water. ",

    "description": "You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. You can create the arcane eye at any point you can see, but it can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. An arcane eye travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there. The eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye can't enter another plane of existence, even through a gate or similar magical portal. You must concentrate to use an arcane eye. If you do not concentrate, the eye is inert until you again concentrate. Material Component: A bit of bat fur. ",
