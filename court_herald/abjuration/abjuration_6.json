    "description": "This powerful spell is primarily used to defend your stronghold. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area. Fog: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No. Arcane Locks: All doors in the warded area are arcane locked. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No. Webs:Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the web spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for web. Spell Resistance: No. Confusion:Where there are choices in direction—such as a corridor intersection or side passage—a minor confusion-type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is an enchantment, mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: Yes. Lost Doors:One door per caster level is covered by a silent image to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance: No. In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects. 1.  Dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No. 2.  A magic mouth in two places. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No. 3.  A stinking cloud in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for stinking cloud. Spell Resistance: No. 4.  A gust of wind in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: Yes. 5.  A suggestion in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell Resistance: Yes. The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful Mordenkainen's disjunction destroys the entire guards and wards effect. Material Component: Burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, and a small amount of blood. Focus: A small silver rod. ",

    "description": "An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you.  The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities.  Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines. \nAn antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it.  A hasted creature, for example, is not hasted while inside the field, but the spell resumes functioning when the creature leaves the field.  Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration.  \nSummoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field.  They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away.  Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature.  If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out.  (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as create water, are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result).  \nA normal creature (a normally encountered griffon rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles.  Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that).  The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures).  Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned.  These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field.  Dispel magic does not remove the field. \nTwo or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other.  Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field (see the individual spell descriptions).  Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. (See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more about artifacts). \nShould a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field. \nArcane Material Component: A pinch of powdered iron or iron filings.
