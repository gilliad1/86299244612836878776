    "description": "The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision.  If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too.  If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. \nItems dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature.  Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source).  Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope. \nOf course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).  The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature.  For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe.  (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions).  Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell.  Causing harm indirectly is not an attack.  Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth.  If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.  Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.  See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat. \nInvisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell. \nArcane Material Component: An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.

    "description": "By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras (detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, and the like). On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the subject of misdirection is detected as if it were the other object. (Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect). Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, and the like). ",

    "description": "Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck. Mirror image creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total). These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you. You can move into and through a mirror image. When you and the mirror image separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on. Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against an image destroys it. An image's AC is 10 + your sizemodifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they're burned or dead after being hit by a fireball). While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded. An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded). ",

    "description": "This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: \"Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack sits cross-legged within a distance of one foot\". Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, metal clanking) or to a specific noise or spoken word (when a pin drops, or when anyone says \"Boo\"). Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. For example, \"Speak when any creature touches the statue\"is an acceptable command if the creature is visible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance. Magic mouth can be made permanent with a permanency spell. Material Component: A small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth 10 gp. ",
