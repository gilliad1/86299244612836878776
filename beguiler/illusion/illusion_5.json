You overlay phantasmal images over your enemies, making them appear to each other as loathsome and despicable, implanting an urge to kill and destroy the object of their ire. Orcs might see each other as elves or dwarves, demons might see angels, and so on. All subjects receive a Will save to see through the phantasm. Each individual failing its save turns on the closest ally and attacks until the first time it deals damage, which causes the spell to end for that attacker.
