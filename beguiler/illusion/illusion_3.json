The swordfighters do not hinder movement, block terrain, or block line of effect.  They can flank an opponent with each other and with your allies. \nEach swordfighter has hit points equal to twice your caster level and an Armor Class of 25.  It makes saving throws or checks with a bonus equal to your caster level.  \nThe swordsmen's attacks are at a bonus equal to your caster level, they threaten critical hits on a 19 or 20, and they deal 1d8 points of slashing damage with a +1 bonus per three caster levels (max +5).  They only make attacks of opportunity, and their weapon damage is slashing and is affected by damage reduction. \nMaterial Component: A pewter swordfighter miniature figure. ",
