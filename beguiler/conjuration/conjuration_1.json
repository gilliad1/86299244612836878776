Unlike mundane armor, mage armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction.  Since mage armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor. \nFocus: A piece of cured leather. ",

    "description": "A misty vapor arises around you.  It is stationary once created.  The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.  A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance).  Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). \nA moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds.  A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.  A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area.  A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.  This spell does not function underwater. ",
