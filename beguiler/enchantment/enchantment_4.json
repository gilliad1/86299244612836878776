Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character.  Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes.  Note that a confused character will not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked). \nArcane Material Component: A set of three nut shells.
