    "description": "Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character. The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans. Ghost sound can enhance the effectiveness of a silent image spell. Ghost sound can be made permanent with a permanency spell. Material Component: A bit of wool or a small lump of wax. ",

Upon touching your intended targets, you note with satisfaction that the area around all of you seems a little cleaner and less tread upon. \nThis spell flawlessly disguises the spoor left by the subjects, concealing their tracks, scent, and other signs of their passage with an illusion that defeats even the senses of taste and touch.  Any creature making a Search check, using the scent ability, or using the Survival skill to track a creature affected by this spell interacts with the illusion and can make a will save to disbelieve.  Creatures that succeed on the save can detect the subjects normally.  Creatures merely passing through an area the subjects passed through do not count as interacting with the illusion. Targets of this spell can make a Will save to negate it, and spell resistance applies. Material Component: A pinch of some odoriferous spice. ",

A \"weapon\" is defined as any manufactured weapon. With the aid of this spell, you can attempt to hide a weapon even if you do not possess the Sleight of Hand skill.

You cannot change your body type.  For example, a human caster could look human, humanoid, or like any other human-shaped bipedal creature.  Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you.  You could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person.  The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment.  A battleaxe made to look like a dagger still functions as a battleaxe. \nIf you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise check. \nA creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.  For example, a creature that touched you and realized that the tactile sensation did not match the visual one would be entitled to such a save. ",

    "description": "You complete the incantation and nearby shadows gather together, assuming your approximate size and shape. You create a shadowy duplicate of yourself at a place you indicate within range. The shadow double attacks any adjacent target (regardless of the weapon it appears to wield), as you desire, starting in the round when you cast the spell. It attacks on your turn once each round, striking with an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus + the modifier for your spell save DCs. Each hit deals 1 point of Strength damage to the target. The first time a target is hit, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect; this negates the damage and renders it immune to further attacks by the shadow double. The shadow double occupies a space identical to yours. It is not incorporeal, and thus can't share a space with another creature or object. It can provide a flanking bonus against any creature that hasn't yet saved successfully against it. The shadow double can strike incorporeal creatures, but not ethereal creatures. Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to direct the shadow double to attack any other target. To attack this new target, the shadow double can move to any new legal space within 30 feet (it moves by instantaneous teleportation). If it is not commanded to switch targets, it continues to attack the same target. A shadow double can be attacked. It has an Armor Class equal to 10 + your size modifier + a deflection bonus equal to the modifier for your spell save DCs, and has one-fifth of your full normal hit points. If the shadow double is reduced to 0 hit points, or if you create a second shadow double when the first still exists, the spell ends. ",
