This spell is one of only a few spells (finding the center being another) that you can cast while maintaining concentration on another spell. Aiming at the target gives you a +10 circumstance bonus on Concentration checks you make to maintain concentration on the other spell, and its effect lasts as long as you concentrate on the other spell (to a maximum of 20 minutes).
