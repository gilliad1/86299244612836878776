    "description": "This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane).  It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn.  It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability.  If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.  \nThe spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying Summon Monster table.  You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.  Information on these creatures can be found in the Monster Manual. \nA summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities.  Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them.  For instance, a celestial porpoise may only be summoned in an aquatic environment. \nWhen you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.  For example, a summon monster I is a lawful and evil spell when cast to summon a fiendish dire rat. \nArcane Focus: A tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) candle. \n1ST LEVEL\n\n\nMonster \nAlignement \n\n\n Celestial dog \n LG \n\n\n Celestial owl \n LG \n\n\n Celestial giant fire beetle \n NG \n\n\n Celestial porpoise 1 \n NG \n\n\n Celestial badger \n CG \n\n\n Celestial monkey \n CG \n\n\n Fiendish dire rat \n LE \n\n\n Fiendish raven \n LE \n\n\n Fiendish monstrous centipede, Medium \n NE \n\n\n Fiendish monstrous scorpion, Small \n NE \n\n\n Fiendish hawk \n CE \n\n\n Fiendish monstrous spider, Small \n CE \n\n\n Fiendish octopus 1 \n CE \n\n\n Fiendish snake, Small viper \n CE \n\n\n1 may be summoned only into an aquatic or watery environment",

    "description": "An unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so, thus allowing you to command it to clean the floor and then turn your attention elsewhere as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet. The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks). If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist. Material Component: A piece of string and a bit of wood. ",

    "description": "A misty vapor arises around you.  It is stationary once created.  The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.  A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance).  Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). \nA moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds.  A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.  A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area.  A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.  This spell does not function underwater. ",
