You release a powerful jet of superheated steam that deals 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d4) to each creature within its area. The jet begins at your fingertips. The jet of steam deals no damage to objects in its path, nor can it set fire to combustibles. ",

Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out.  Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell. \nFor every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missileâ€”two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher.  If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures.  A single missile can strike only one creature.  You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage. ",
