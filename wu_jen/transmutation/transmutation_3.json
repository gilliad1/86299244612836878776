    "description": "The crashing of waves echoes in your ears. This spell converts part of your body into elemental water, which makes you better able to navigate aquatic environments and slip through confined spaces. You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed, which grants you certain benefits (including a +8 racial bonus onSwim checks; see MM 311). You also gain the ability to breathe water (as if under the effect of a water breathing spell). Finally, you gain a +5 enhancement bonus on Escape Artist checks. Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a freedom of movement effect (as the spell) on yourself as a swift action. This benefit lasts for 1 round per level, at the end of which time the spell's entire effect ends. If heart of water is active on you at the same time as heart of air, heart of earth, or heart of fire, you gain light fortification. If all four of these spells are active on you at the same time, you become immune to extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks. ",

    "description": "The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though its size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects (for example, from the mage armor spell) still apply. The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic and becomes immune to poison and critical hits. It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. (This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials). The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the gaseous form spell takes effect. A gaseous creature can't run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet (maneuverability perfect). It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot (such as those that supply armor or natural armor bonuses).

    "description": "The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal.  This extra speed has several effects. \nWhen making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding.  The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation.  (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round). \nA hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves.  Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses. \nAll of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement.  This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed. \nMultiple haste effects don't stack.  Haste dispels and counters slow. \nMaterial Component: A shaving of licorice root. ",
