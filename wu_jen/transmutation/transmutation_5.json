    "description": "You change the subject into a Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD (such as a dog, lizard, monkey, or toad).  The subject takes on all the statistics and special abilities of an average member of the new form in place of its own except as follows:\n\nThe target retains its own alignment (and personality, within the limits of the new form's ability scores). \nIf the target has the shapechanger subtype, it retains that subtype. \nThe target retains its own hit points. \nThe target is treated has having its normal Hit Dice for purpose of adjudicating effects based on HD, such as the sleep spell, though it uses the new form's base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and all other statistics derived from Hit Dice. \nThe target also retains the ability to understand (but not to speak) the languages it understood in its original form.  It can write in the languages it understands, but only the form is capable of writing in some manner (such as drawing in the dirt with a paw). \n\nWith those exceptions, the target's normal game statistics are replaced by those of the new form.  The target loses all the special abilities it has in its normal form, including its class features. \nAll items worn or carried by the subject fall to the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn or carried by the new form. \nIf the new form would prove fatal to the creature (for example, if you polymorphed a landbound target into a fish, or an airborne target into a toad), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save. \nIf the subject remains in the new form for 24 consecutive hours, it must attempt a Will save.  If this save fails, it loses its ability to understand language, as well as all other memories of its previous form, and its Hit Dice and hit points change to match an average creature of its new form.  These abilities and statistics return to normal if the effect is later ended. \nIncorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to baleful polymorph, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action (which ends the spell's effect).

    "description": "You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Thus, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of tress, a rope from a patch of hemp, clothes from flax or wool, and so forth. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by the fabricate spell. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level instead of 10 cubic feet. You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship (jewelry, swords, glass, crystal, and the like). Casting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet (or 1 cubic foot) of material to be affected by the spell. Material Component: The original material, which costs the same amount as the raw materials required to craft the item to be created. ",

    "description": "A number of animals grow to twice their normal size and eight times their normal weight.  This alteration changes each animal's size category to the next largest (from Large to Huge, for example), grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a -2 size penalty to Dexterity.  The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2.  The size change also affects the animal's modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage, as detailed on Table 2-2 in the Dungeon Master's Guide.  The animal's space and reach change as indicated on Table 8-4: Creature Size and Scale (page 149), but its speed does not change. \nThe spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. \nSpecial: When casting animal growth as a Scalykind Domain spell, only ophidian and reptilian creatures are affected. \nIf insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process.  If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing itâ€”the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size. \nAll equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.  Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size. \nThe spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals. \nMultiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of an animal that's still under the effect of the first casting.
