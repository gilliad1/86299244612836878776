    "description": "The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision.  If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too.  If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. \nItems dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature.  Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source).  Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope. \nOf course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).  The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature.  For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe.  (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions).  Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell.  Causing harm indirectly is not an attack.  Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth.  If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.  Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.  See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat. \nInvisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell. \nArcane Material Component: An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.

    "description": "By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras (detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, and the like). On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the subject of misdirection is detected as if it were the other object. (Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect). Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, and the like). ",
