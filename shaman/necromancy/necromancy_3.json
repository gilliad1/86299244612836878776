    "description": "By casting this spell, you project your spirit into the body of an animal, forcing the animal to behave as you direct it. Your own body lies lifeless for the duration of the spell. The animal must be a normal animal (not a beast, magical beast, vermin, or other monster type) and must have fewer Hit Dice than your level. The animal's soul remains in its body, but it has no control over that body while your spirit is there. While in the animal's body, you keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. For every 2 points of damage taken by the animal body while you are possessing it, you take 1 point of damage as well. If the animal body is killed while you are possessing it, you must make a Fortitude save (DC 10) or die as well. If your body is destroyed while your spirit is in the animal's body, you die at the end of the spell's duration. Material Component: A bowl of incense and a morsel of food appealing to the animal. ",
