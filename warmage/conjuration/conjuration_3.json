A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details). The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires. Arcane Material Component: A pinch of dust and a few drops of water. ",

This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately for each nauseated character). Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn. Stinking cloud can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
