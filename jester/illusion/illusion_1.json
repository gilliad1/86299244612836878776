Each creature within the cone is affected according to its Hit Dice. 2 HD or less: The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious). 3 or 4 HD: The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round. 5 or more HD: The creature is stunned for 1 round. Sightless creatures are not affected by color spray. Material Component: A pinch each of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue. ",

    "description": "You make yourself—including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment—look different.  You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between.  You cannot change your body type.  For example, a human caster could look human, humanoid, or like any other human-shaped bipedal creature.  Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you.  You could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person.  The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment.  A battleaxe made to look like a dagger still functions as a battleaxe. \nIf you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise check. \nA creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.  For example, a creature that touched you and realized that the tactile sensation did not match the visual one would be entitled to such a save. ",

    "description": "You alter an item's aura so that it registers to detect spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were nonmagical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. You could make an ordinary sword register as a +2 vorpal sword as far as magical detection is concerned or make a +2 vorpal sword register as if it were a +1 sword or even a nonmagical sword. If the object bearing Nystul's magic aura has identify cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is. If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), Nystul's magic aura doesn't work. Note: A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.
