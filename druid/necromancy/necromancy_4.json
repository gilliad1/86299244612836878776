    "description": "A red mist rises from the ground as you intone this spell, billowing outward from you.  Within it you see leaves curl up, scrolls rot from their spindles, and the leather armor of your foes drip from their vulnerable forms. \nMiasma of entropy causes accelerated decay in all wood, leather, and other natural materials in the spell's area.  It destroys nonmagical objects of wood, leather, paper, and other formerly living organic matter.  All such objects within the area rot into slimy, pulpy masses.  Objects weighing more than 1 pound per caster level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are ruined. \nAlternatively, you can target miasma of entropy against a single solid object of nonliving nonmagical organic matter that weighs up to 10 pounds per caster level.

    "description": "With this spell, you can return a dead creature to 0 hit points, provided it died within the last round. You take 1d4 points of damage per Hit Die of the creature affected, and your spell resistance cannot overcome this damage. The subject's soul must be free and willing to return (see Bringing Back the Dead, page 171 of the Player's Handbook). If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject who wants to return receives no saving throw. Last breath cures enough damage to bring the subject's current hit points to 0. Any ability scores damaged to 0 or below are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. The spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, but missing body parts are still missing when the creature returns to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject loses one level when it returns to life, just as if it had lost a level to an energy-draining creature. This level loss cannot be repaired by any spell. A subject who was previously 1st level loses 1 point of Constitution instead. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level. Last breath has no effect on a creature that has been dead for more than 1 round. A creature that died from a death effect can't be raised by this spell, nor can constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures. Last breath cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age. ",

    "description": "A touch from your hand outlines an undead creature in a faint yellow glow, making it vulnerable to many of the dangers that can harm living creatures. \nFor the duration of the spell, the undead creature is subject to extra damage from critical hits (and thus sneak attacks), nonlethal damage, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, and damage to its physical ability scores (though it still lacks a Constitution score and thus can't take Constitution damage) as if it were alive. \nIt loses its immunity to effects that require a Fortitude save, as well as its invulnerability to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, and death effects.  However, an undead affected by this spell gains a bonus on its Fortitude saves equal to its Charisma bonus (if any).  (The bonus doesn't apply to Fortitude saves against effects that also affect objects. ) It must breathe, eat, and sleep just like a normal living creature (though the last two aren't likely to come into play thanks to the spell's short duration). \nWhile it is under the effect of this spell, both negative energy (such as inflict spells) and positive energy (such as cure spells) heal damage to the undead creature, rather than damaging it. \nAn undead creature affected by this spell retains all of its other traits.

The spell has no effect on the soil, so new growth can replace the dead plants. This effect allows no saving throw.
