    "description": "You put a creature into a state of suspended animation, slowing its life functions to almost imperceptible levels and allowing a creature to survive for weeks without food or water. This suspension of life functions automatically stabilizes a dying creature, and it can save starving or dehydrated creatures from death. Creatures affected by a hibernate spell have a slower metabolism, healing wounds at a rate of just 1 hit point per level per week. If the target is unwilling, it is entitled a Will saving throw. A successful saving throw negates the effect of the spell; a failure allows the target an additional saving throw whenever it takes damage, when it is splashed with water or other liquids, or when 24 hours pass, whichever comes first.

    "description": "Your touch thins the blood of your target, causing it to spill with unnatural ease. For the duration of the spell, the subject bleeds profusely through any open wound. Each new hit from a piercing or slashing weapon or effect that deals damage to the subject also deals 1 point of Constitution damage. This ability damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. Because this spell thins the subject's blood, repeated uses cause additional difficulty. In addition to the extra damage, a target subjected to a second use of this spell before the first has expired also takes a -4 penalty on Fortitude saves against disease, poison, or the sickened and nauseated conditions. Creatures with no discernible anatomy (such as plants and oozes) and those immune to critical hits (such as undead and constructs) are immune to this spell. ",
