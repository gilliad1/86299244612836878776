    "description": "Upon casting this spell, you must choose one disease from this list: blinding sickness, cackle fever, filth fever, mindfire, red ache, the shakes, or slimy doom (see Disease in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER'S Guide for descriptions). The touched creature contracts the disease you have selected immediately (no incubation period) unless it makes a successful Fortitude save. Unlike a creature affected by contagion, the subject of an epidemic spell becomes a powerful vector for spreading the disease. As long as the subject is afflicted with the disease, any living creature (except the caster) within 30 feet of him or her must make a Fortitude save or immediately contract the disease, regardless of its usual incubation period or method of transmission. Anyone infected in this manner also becomes a vector for the disease and can spread it in the same manner. The save DC drops by 1 each day after the spell is cast, regardless of when any particular creature contracted it. A creature that makes a successful Fortitude save against this particular epidemic cannot contract that disease by any means for one day. Thereafter, coming within 30 feet of an infected creature requires another save, with the same consequences for failure or success. You are immune to any infection that originates from your own casting. ",
