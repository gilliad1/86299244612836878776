A few spoken phrases, backed by magical power, and that oppression seems to lift. \nThis abjuration grants a creature limited protection from a plane's alignment traits (DMG 149).  When the subject visits a plane with an alignment trait, this spell grants it immunity to penalties on its Charisma-based checks that mildly aligned planes impose on visitors of opposed alignments.  The Charisma-, Wisdom-, and Intelligence based check penalties associated with strongly aligned planes are halved while the spell's duration lasts. ",
