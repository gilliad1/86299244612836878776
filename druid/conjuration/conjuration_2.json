    "description": "A swirling snow vapor arises around you, and follows you from that point on. The snow obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the snow in 4 rounds. A very strong wind (31+ mph) disperses the snow in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the snow in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A wall of fire burns away the snow in the area into which it deals damage. This spell does not function underwater. Creatures with snowsight are immune to the effects of this spell. ",
