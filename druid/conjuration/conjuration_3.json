The space must be large enough to accommodate the creature. If not, the spell automatically fails. Upon appearing, the cube acts on your turn, attacking the nearest living creature each round. You have no control over it and cannot direct it. The gelatinous cube remains until it is destroyed or has no remaining targets to attack, at which point it moves away in a random direction. ",

    "description": "A bank of fog composed entirely of tiny, razor-sharp ice shards billows out from the targeted point. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). In addition, the sharp ice particles tear the skin of those moving through the area, causing 4 points of damage per round, half of which is cold damage. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. Dispersing the fog in this manner, however, causes damage to those within its area as the icy shards whip past.

A creature within 5 feet has concealment. Creatures farther away have total concealment. Unprotected, nonmagical flames are automatically extinguished, and there is a 50% chance that protected flames will be snuffed. In addition to obscuring sight, the swirling dust abrades any creature within it or attempting to move through it. Any creature passing through the haze takes 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4), with no save allowed. If you conjure haboob so that it appears where creatures are located, each creature takes damage as if passing through the haze. Such creatures take half damage with a successful Reflex save, but if these creatures do not leave the affected area at their next opportunity, they take full damage from the abrading sands (no save) as if they had voluntarily entered the area. Any creature that remains within the affected area for more than 1 round likewise takes damage automatically (no save). A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the dust in 8 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses it in 4 rounds. This spell does not function underwater. Material Component: A pinch of ash, dust, or sand.
