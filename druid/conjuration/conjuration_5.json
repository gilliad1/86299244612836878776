    "description": "You create a tentacle-shaped mass of blackwater, drawn from the deepest ocean trenches, to attack an enemy as you direct it. The tentacle appears at a particular point within range and can't move from that location. It attacks the opponent you designate once each round, starting with the round the spell is cast. It has a reach of 20 feet (though it can't make attacks of opportunity). Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level plus the ability modifier you would normally use to set the save DC (Wisdom for cleric or druid, Intelligence for wizard, Charisma for sorcerer). The tentacle deals 2d8 + caster level (max. +20) points of damage with a successful hit. Any Large or smaller creature hit by a blackwater tentacle must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain a negative level. Multiple hits by the same tentacle are cumulative, but the negative levels last only for the duration of the spell. The tentacle never provides nor benefits from a flanking bonus. Once a tentacle has been directed to attack a foe, it continues to do so until the spell is redirected to a new target (a move action). The tentacle has 5 hit points per caster level and an AC of 10 + your caster level. It automatically fails all saves. If reduced to 0 hp, the tentacle is destroyed. Material Component: Powdered squid beak and a single dried sucker from a kraken's tentacle. ",

    "description": "You become shrouded in a dense cloud of yellow mold spores. You can see through the cloud with ease and are not affected by it in any way, but it provides you one-half concealment (20% miss chance). The cloak of swirling yellow spores travels with you and does not leave a trail as you move. Anyone who passes through your square, or anyone whom you successfully overrun, bull rush, grapple, or who otherwise shares your area must make a Fortitude saving throw or suffer 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage; another Fortitude saving throw is required 1 minute later to avoid taking 2d6 points of temporary Constitution damage. As long as the spore cloak is active, you are immune to fungal infestations such as the spores of brown or yellow mold and the rotting touch of violet fungi. If you fail a saving throw against a fire spell or effect, the spores are instantly burnt away and the spell ends. If you are in direct sunlight, the spell continues but the spores become inert until you reach shelter. Inert spores continue to provide one-half concealment but cannot infest others and do not provide protection from fungal attacks. ",

    "description": "With a rush of hot air, a swirling wall of blowing sand leaps into being. \nThis spell conjures up a 10-foot-thick, viscous, opaque wall of swirling sand.  The spell must be cast so that it rests on a solid surface.  Once cast, the wall is immobile.  The sand is sufficiently thick to block ranged attacks, providing normal cover appropriate for its size, but creatures can attempt to force their way through it.  Moving through a wall of sand is difficult, requiring a full-round action and a Strength check.  A creature moves 5 feet through a wall of sand for every 5 points by which its Strength check result exceeds 10. \nCreatures within a wall of sand are considered blinded and deafened, and they are unable to speak or breathe.  Thus, they might begin to suffocate (DMG 304) if they remain within the wall too long.  Spells with verbal components cannot be cast within the wall, and any other spell requires a successful Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). \nCreatures with reach can attempt to attack through the wall, but targets have total concealment and total cover, and the attacker must have a general idea where the target is located. \nAny open, unprotected flame thrust into a wall of sand is instantly extinguished. \nArcane Material Component: A handful of sand.
