    "description": "A rushing torrent of liquid rock bursts from the ground, washing over your foes. You create a liquid landslide of molten-hot volcanic material. All creatures in the area of the spell take 10d6 points of fire damage. Additionally, those creatures are coated in a thick layer of the viscous substance, slowing them (as the slow spell) for the next 3 rounds and dealing an additional 5d6 points of fire damage per round. A successful Reflex save reduces the initial damage by half and prevents the slow effect and the additional damage. ",
