You can attack with both claws at your full attack bonus, but your bite attack takes a â€”2 penalty (as if you had the Multiattack feat).  Each claw deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if you are Small) + your Str modifier, and your bite deals 2d8 points of damage (2d6 if you are Small) + 1/2 your Str modifier.  You gain the benefits of the Blind-Fight and Power Attack feats, as well.  If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks. \nMaterial Component: A tuft of bear fur.
