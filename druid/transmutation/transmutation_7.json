    "description": "When you place specially prepared stones on the ground and speak a command to conclude the casting of this spell, the stones transform into creatures that look and fight just like liths (see Chapter 6). These stone-born creatures are not true liths, however; they cannot converse with actual liths or use any of a lith's psionic powers. These stone-born liths defend you and obey any spoken commands. When reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, a stone-born lith crumbles to powder, and the prepared stone used to create it is destroyed. Otherwise, the stone-born liths revert to prepared stones when the duration of the spell expires, and these stones can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The stone-born liths are always at full strength when created, despite any damage they may have taken the last time they appeared. You can prepare up to one stone per four caster levels, to a maximum of five stones at 20th level. A stone can remain prepared indefinitely; the spell isn't actually cast until you complete it by changing the stone into a lith. Focus: The requisite number of stones, which must be specially prepared. The materials for polishing and smoothing each stone cost 200 gp. Once the stones are prepared, you must perform a rite of purification that requires one day per stone. You cannot adventure or engage in any other strenuous activity during the purification process.

Your creature type changes to outsider. Unlike other outsiders, you can be brought back to life if you die in this form. You gain the following qualities and abilities:\n\nImmunity to cold. \nDamage reduction 10/magic and piercing. \nAt the beginning of your action, creatures within 15 feet of you take 2d6 points of cold damage per round. \nA creature that takes damage from this effect must make a Fortitude save (DC 17 + your key ability modifier) or be slowed, as the slow spell, for the remaining duration of as the frost.

    "description": "You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. The current, natural weather conditions are determined by the DM. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in. You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather—where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously—fog and strong wind, for example. Control weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.
