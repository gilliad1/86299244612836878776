    "description": "With this spell, you can trigger the insightful and baleful magic of a mandrake root. When you pull it from its dark container, you and all other creatures within 15 feet must make a Will save against its scream. Those who succeed gain a true seeing effect; those who fail behave as though affected by confusion. Both effects last until the spell ends. Material Component: A mandrake root worth at least 100 gp in a secure container with the same value. ",
