Each creature or object in the area is subject to damage equal to 2d6 + caster level. Any creature struck by this attack must then succeed on a Fortitude save or be driven 10 feet away from the center of the blast. If a ship is in the area, the captain must immediately make a sinking check (DC equal to spell save DC). See Sinking, page 32. At least half of the spell's area must contain water at least 10 feet deep, or else the spell fails. You must center the effect at or below the water's surface.

A creature to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural takes double damage. A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half. An undead creature caught within the globe takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6), or half damage if a Reflex save is successful. In addition, the burst results in the destruction of any undead creature specifically harmed by bright light (such as a vampire) if it fail its save. The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead creatures. Sunburst dispels any darkness spells of lower than 9th level within its area. Arcane Material Component: A piece of sunstone and a naked flame. ",
