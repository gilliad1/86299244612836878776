This spell functions like globe of invulnerability, except that it affects only fire spells. In addition, the frosty opaqueness of the globe grants concealment (20%miss chance) to those within the area against attacks from outside. Likewise, targets outside the globe gain concealment against attacks from those within the spell's area. Arcane Material Component: A tiny sphere of ice that shatters at the expiration of the spell.
