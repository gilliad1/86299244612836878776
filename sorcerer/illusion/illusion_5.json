This does not grant you the ability to open another such portal automatically, so the spell is often used as a temporary hiding place or a method of gaining access to the Plane of Shadow. \nThe portal remains for the duration of the spell, and other creatures can pass through it in either direction if they make a Will save.  The portal is invisible from the Material Plane and looks like a white hole on the Plane of Shadow. \nYou must be in a region of heavy shadows to cast shadowfade.  The spell can be cast only on a plane coexistent with the Plane of Shadow (DMG 152), and it cannot be cast on the Plane of Shadow itself. ",

A creature subjected to this spell feels a spiking fever accompanied by vertigo and a phantasmagoric confusion of the senses. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the dream as unreal.

Regardless of the outcome of the Fortitude save, the subject has difficulty focusing its mind on spellcasting. Each time it attempts to cast, concentrate on, or direct a spell, it must first succeed on a Concentration check (DC equal to this spell's save DC + the level of the spell being used). When this spell ends (whether because its duration ends, you dismiss it, or it is dispelled), the subject is confused for 1 round afterward. If the subject of fever dream is already under the effect of a luminous swarm spell (see page 110), the Will save DC of this spell (as well as the DC for Concentration checks required by this spell) increases by 2. If the subject of fever dream is already under the effect of a prickling torment spell (see page 113), the Fortitude save DC of this spell increases by 2. ",
