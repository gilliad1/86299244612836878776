Additionally, at the end of your turn, you can ready a single standard action regardless of the number of actions taken this turn. Thus, you can move at your movement rate, make a single attack, and then at the end of your turn ready an action to cast a single spell with a casting time of one standard action. This behaves as a readied action in all other ways, including the change in your initiative. If you take the readied action, the spell's effect ends immediately. Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), your bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves improves to +3. ",

Further, the subject can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces).

    "description": "Legend lore brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4Ã—10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are \"legendary\", as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds. Examples of legend lore results include the following. A divination about a mysterious magic axe you have at hand: \"Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft chops the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Son or Daughter of Stone, one who loves Moradin and whom Moradin loves, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word 'Rudnogg'on the lips\". A divination about a legendary paladin about whom you know many details: \"Vanashon has been denied the glory of death and the duty of life. He waits patiently beneath the Forbidden Mountain\". (The paladin has been turned to stone in the caverns under the mountain). A divination about ancient ruins about which you have only a passing reference in a partially damaged tome: \"The sorcerer who called herself Ryth built a library without words and a temple without gods. Those who read and those who pray tore it down in a night and a day\". (These clues may be enough for you to find out more and get details you need to cast a better legend lore).

    "description": "At the culmination of this long ritual, you gaze into your scrying focus and stretch out your sight. The mists within the reflective surface dissipate, and suddenly you can see and hear a familiar place. You can see and hear what occurs at a location, which can be at any distance on the same plane where you are located. You must make a successful caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) to scry a specific location. The difficulty of this check depends on how familiar you are with that location and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that place. Furthermore, the difficulty to scry the desired locale increases if the location is extremely far removed, indoors or underground, or on another plane. The DC of this check is 20 + any modifiers related to your knowledge of the area, your connection to it, and the location's distance, as set out in the following table. If you fail this check, the scrying attempt simply fails. If the caster level check succeeds, you create an invisible magical sensor in any location you desire. Through this sensor you can both see and hear, your vantage and range of vision being the same as if you were actually at that place, allowing you to make Spot and Listen checks as normal. You can rotate the sensor as you wish, seeing in any direction you desire. Once the spell is cast, however, you cannot change the position of the sensor. As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects. In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, and message. If the caster level check fails, you can't attempt to scry on any place within 1 mile of that location until 24 hours have passed. Arcane Material Component: The eye of a mole, a badger, or a xorn, plus nitric acid, copper, and zinc. Wizard, Sorcerer, or Bard Focus: A mirror of finely wrought and highly polished silver costing not less than 1,000 gp. The mirror must be at least 2 feet by 4 feet. Cleric Focus: A holy water font costing not less than 100 gp. Druid Focus: A natural pool of water. ",
