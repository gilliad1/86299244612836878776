When the spell expires, you return to material existence. An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects (such as magic missile and wall of force) and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as a basilisk's gaze attack). Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material. If you end the spell and become material while inside a material object (such as a solid wall), you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet that you so travel.

You sprout a pair of dull gleaming wings made of overlapping feathers of dark metal. You grow a pair of adamantine wings. The wings grant you a fly speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor or carry a medium or heavy load), with good maneuverability. If you are not flying, you can use a standard action to make one wing attack or a full attack action to make two such attacks (as if they were natural weapons). Each wing deals 2d6 points of slashing damage (plus your Strength modifier), and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20. The wings are considered both magic and adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction or penetrating hardness. Wing strikes are not additional attacks; they replace any other attack or full attack action. As a swift action, you can choose to launch the adamantine feathers as a burst of razor-sharp blades. This attack takes the form of a 60-foot cone-shaped burst. All creatures within the cone take 10d6 points of damage (Reflex half; spell resistance applies). Since this is a spell effect, damage reduction does not affect the damage dealt by the cone. This action immediately ends the spell's duration. ",

Otherwise, the stone-born liths revert to prepared stones when the duration of the spell expires, and these stones can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The stone-born liths are always at full strength when created, despite any damage they may have taken the last time they appeared. You can prepare up to one stone per four caster levels, to a maximum of five stones at 20th level. A stone can remain prepared indefinitely; the spell isn't actually cast until you complete it by changing the stone into a lith.
