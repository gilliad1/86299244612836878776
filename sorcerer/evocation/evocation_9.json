    "description": "You create a moving wall of water that can drown swimmers, swamp ships, and flood port cities. Upon completion of the spell, the tidal wave forms and moves from the starting point you designate in the direction you specify at a speed of 150 feet per round for the duration of the spell, or until it strikes land. Any creature swimming in the water as the tidal wave hits it must make a DC 30 Swim check each round to remain afloat. Creatures that succeed are washed forward by the tidal wave and must continue to make Swim checks each round. Creatures that fail the check are sucked beneath the tidal wave and forced 8d10 feet below the surface of the water, taking 4d6 points of nonlethal damage. The wave passes over submerged creatures, which are subject to drowning (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Any Medium or smaller ship caught in the path of the tidal wave takes 6d10 points of damage, while larger ships take an additional 6d10 points of damage per size category they are larger than Medium. Furthermore, the ship is carried along by the tidal wave for a number of feet equal to the number of points of damage taken x5. For example, a sailing ship that takes 66 points of damage is carried in the surge of the wave for 330 feet. If the movement of the ship results in a collision with another ship or with land, the ship takes additional damage (see below). Any creatures and equipment aboard the ship that are not lashed down are swept off the decks and into the sea (and creatures are then subject to the Swim checks noted above). If a tidal wave drives up onto shore, it deals 6d10 points of damage to everything in its path within 200 feet of the shore, 3d10 points of damage to everything farther than 200 feet but within 400 feet of the shore, and 1d10 points of damage to everything farther than 400 feet but within 1,000 feet of shore. Any ships in port or washed ahead of the tidal wave take 6d10 points of damage in addition to any taken for being struck by the wave (see above) and end up 5d10Ã—10 feet inland when they come to rest.

    "description": "This powerful variant of the contingency spell automatically transfers you and everything you carry or touch (except for other creatures or objects that weigh more than 50 pounds) to a locale you name. When casting Elminster's evasion, you must specify the locale and detail up to six specific conditions that trigger the spell. When any of these situations occurs, your body, mind, and soul are whisked away to the location. The location can be any place you have visited, even on another plane. Also when casting the spell, you cast teleport without error and one or two other spells that are to take effect when you arrive at your destination. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for all castings. If the companion spells have combined casting times longer than 10 minutes, use the combined casting times instead. The teleport without error spell whisks you through the Astral Plane to your destination, so anything that prevents astral travel also foils Elminster's evasion. The spells to be brought into effect by the evasion must be ones that affect your person (feather fall, levitate, fly, teleport, and so on) and be of a spell level no higher than one-third of your caster level (maximum 6th level). The conditions you specify to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general (see the contingency spell, in Chapter 11 of the Player's Handbook). The spell pulls together your mind, body, and soul if they have been separated. For example, if your soul is trapped in a magic jar when the evasion is triggered, your soul returns to your body. (This breaks the magic jar spell). If your body or soul has been magically trapped (for example with a binding, imprisonment, or trap the soul spell),you must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the person who cast the trapping spell). If you succeed, the trapping spell is broken and the evasion works. If you fail, the evasion fails. If you're dead when you arrive at your destination, your soul immediately departs just as though you died at your destination. Material Components: Those of the companion spells, plus quicksilver; an eyelash of an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell-using creature; and some of your own blood, freshly drawn. Drawing the blood deals 1d4 points of temporary Constitution damage. Focus: A statuette of you carved from ivory and decorated with gems (worth at least 1,500 gp).

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, the chain fails to encircle it and dissipates harmlessly. Otherwise, the chain surrounds the target, with the following effects: The target creature cannot leave the area defined by the chain. Other creatures can enter or leave the area (although they must succeed on a DC 15 Escape Artist check or a DC 15 Tumble check to slip past the chain). If the target was in midair (flying, levitating, and so on) when the chain took effect, the chain suspends the target in midair safely as if it had a solid floor on which to stand. The chain prevents the target from changing form, including lycanthropic form changes, vampiric transformations, or polymorph or similar effects. The chain acts as a dimensional anchor upon the target. The chain deals 2d6 points of force damage per round to the target. No magic functions within the chain, as if the chain defined the area of an antimagic field. This means that the target cannot use any magic, and no magic from outside the chain affects the creature.
