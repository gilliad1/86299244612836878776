    "description": "This spell creates a shadowy tentacle of energy that extends 30 feet from your hand, splitting off into three smaller tentacles about 10 feet from its end. Each of these smaller tentacles ends in a fanged, slavering maw. All three of these mouths can be directed to attack as a full-round action, or one of them can attack as a standard action. You can direct the mouths to attack separate targets as long as all targets are within 10 feet of each other. Each mouth strikes with an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus the modifier for the ability score that controls your spellcasting, and each deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. Because the mouths are tangible, they can be destroyed. Each has an AC of 15 and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level. If a mouth is destroyed, it fades away into nothingness, but the other mouths remain. If all the mouths are destroyed, the spell's duration ends. The main tentacle cannot be attacked. Material Component: Three hairs and a tooth. ",
