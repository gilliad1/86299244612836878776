The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container).  Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation when used.  (Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell). \nArcane Material Component: Powdered lime and carbon. ",

The warmth passes into the armor and manifests as a sparkling shine. _\nDiamondsteel enhances the strength of one suit of metal armor.  The armor provides damage reduction equal to half the AC bonus of the armor.  This damage reduction can be overcome only by adamantine weapons.  For example, a suit of full plate would provide damage reduction 4/adamantine, and a +1 breastplate (+6 AC) would provide damage reduction 3/adamantine. \nMaterial Component: Diamond dust worth at least 50 gp.
