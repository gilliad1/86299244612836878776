If the dragon fails its save and does anything except attack you or move to attack you it takes a penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws based on the strength of your dragonmark. \n\n\nDragonmark \nPenalty \n\n\n Least \n -5 \n\n\n Lesser \n -10 \n\n\n Greater or Siberys \n -20 \n\n\nThis spell ends abruptly if line of sight between you and the dragon is broken, or if you are disabled, dying, or dead.  A dragon under the effect of multiple taunt dragon spells takes the penalties only if it fails to attack or move toward the caster who affected it last. \nDragonmark: Any true dragonmark. ",
