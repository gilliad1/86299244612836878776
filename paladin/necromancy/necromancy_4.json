    "description": "When moral persuasion fails to win a criminal over to right conduct, you can use mark of justice to encourage the miscreant to walk the straight and narrow path. You draw an indelible mark on the subject and state some behavior on the part of the subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject. Typically, you designate some sort of criminal behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the effect of bestow curse. Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you can cast it only on a creature that is willing or restrained. Like the effect of bestow curse, a mark of justice cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Remove curse works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than your mark of justice caster level. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the mark has activated. ",

    "description": "This spell has two possible effects: Divine Fortitude: The target becomes immune to subdual damage, charm effects, compulsions, and attacks that function by causing pain, and is immune to effects that would cause her to be dazed, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, staggered, or stunned. The target remains conscious at -1 to -9 hit points and can take a partial action each round when in that state. If any of these effects are present on the target when this spell is cast, they are suspended for the duration (causing the target to wake if unconscious). This variant of the spell lasts 1 minute/level. When the spell ends, any effects suspended by the spell that would otherwise still be in effect (such as fatigue, which normally requires 8 hours of rest to abate) return. Effects with durations that expired during the duration of this spell do not resume when this spell ends. Pact of Martyrdom: You and the target exchange hit point totals. This variant of the spell only works if you have more hit points than the target when the spell is cast. If the target was unconscious and dying, you become unconscious and dying. If the target was unconscious but stabilized, you become unconscious but stabilized. The spell only transfers actual hit points, not temporary hit points. Clerics and paladins who don't worship Ilmater name this spell after their own deityâ€”favor of Torm, for example. ",
