    "description": "With a mighty invocation to your deity, you mark a creature as a target of your holy judgment. The ground shakes, the air grows still, and all wild animals in the air become suddenly quiet and fearful as your deity passes judgment upon the target. This spell marks an opponent as an enemy of your faith, one who must pay for his transgressions. As long as the subject insists on fighting, it suffers divine punishment from your deity. The subject of this spell takes 1d6 points of damage each time it casts a spell that causes damage or disables a creature, makes a melee or ranged attack, or uses spell-like or supernatural abilities to harm other creatures. The subject of this spell must have an alignment that opposes yours on at least one axisâ€”evil if you are good, lawful if you are chaotic, and so on. For example, a chaotic good cleric can place a mark of doom upon a lawful good, lawful evil, or neutral evil opponent. A neutral caster can use this spell against any good, evil, lawful, or chaotic foe. ",

    "description": "The touched creature dies painlessly. Instead of passing immediately beyond the Veil of Souls, the creature's soul remains on the Ethereal Plane and attempts to enter the Material Plane as a ghost. Normally, this is used by ghost characters with a special nonhumanoid companion (such as a mage's familiar, a druid or ranger's animal companion, or a paladin's special mount) to allow the companion to travel with them in ghost form. When the spell expires, the ghost creature dies the true death and its soul passes beyond the Veil of Souls. It can be raised or resurrected before the spell duration expires, of course. ",
