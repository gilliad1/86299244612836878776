    "description": "A halo of green-gold light surrounds you, and then snakes outward into the mind of a nearby foe. You project an instantaneous surge of mental energy that overwhelms a weak-minded foe. The target stops and stares blankly, fascinated for 3 rounds. In addition, any creature under the effect of this spell takes a -2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting effects you create. Special: A green dragon capable of casting 6th-level sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action. ",
