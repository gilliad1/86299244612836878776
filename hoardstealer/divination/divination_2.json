    "description": "You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. The spell locates such objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, tools, weapons, or even a ladder. You can search for general items such as a stairway, a sword, or a jewel, in which case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain item, such as a particular piece of jewelry, requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique item (such as \"Baron Vulden's signet ring\") unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination). The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell. Polymorph any object fools it. Arcane Focus: A forked twig. ",
