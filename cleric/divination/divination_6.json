    "description": "Vague, translucent shadows of your body's form move just out of sync with your own motions, a visible sign that you exist in two places in time. You can see into the future, slightly anticipating your opponents' next moves. You gain a +2 insight bonus to Armor Class and a +2 insight bonus on Reflex saves. Additionally, at the end of your turn, you can ready a single standard action regardless of the number of actions taken this turn. Thus, you can move at your movement rate, make a single attack, and then at the end of your turn ready an action to cast a single spell with a casting time of one standard action. This behaves as a readied action in all other ways, including the change in your initiative. If you take the readied action, the spell's effect ends immediately. Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), your bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves improves to +3. ",

You gain a +1 insight bonus to Armor Class and a +1 insight bonus on saving throws for the duration of the spell. \nOnce during the spell's duration, you can gain an insight bonus equal to one-half your caster level (maximum +10) on any saving throw.  Activating this effect is an immediate action, but it must be done before you make the roll to be modified.  Once this ability is used, the spell ends. \nIf you have the Dragon Prophesier feat (see page 46), you can enter a state of prophetic favor as an immediate action instead of a full-round action while this spell is in effect.  This still counts as one of your daily uses of prophetic favor.  Once this ability is used, the spell ends. \nYou cannot have more than one glimpse of the Prophecy spell active on you at the same time. ",
