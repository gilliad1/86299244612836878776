In such instances, you gain no new information on the first round. ) If the zone is in range but not in your line of sight, you discern its direction but not its exact location. \n2nd Round: Age of the manifest zone.  You gain a very general sense of how long it has existed, as indicated on the following table.  If the zone is going to fade within the next 24 hours, you learn that, too.  Otherwise, you gain no sense of how long it will last. \n3rd Round: The plane to which the manifest zone is connected.  If the zone is small, and fits entirely within the area of your spell, you learn its exact borders and dimensions.  If the zone is larger than that, you do not know the precise location or dimensions of the zone outside your spell area. \nThe spell can penetrate barriers, but a thin sheet of lead, 1 inch of common metal, 1 foot of stone, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. \nMANIFEST ZONE AGE CATEGORIES\n\n\nCategory \nAge \n\n\n Nascent \n Less than 1 day \n\n\n New \n 1 to 30 days \n\n\n Young \n 31 days to 1 year \n\n\n Mature \n 1 to 10 years \n\n\n Old \n 11 to 100 years \n\n\n Ancient \n More than 100 years",
