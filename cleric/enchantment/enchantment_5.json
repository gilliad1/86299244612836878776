    "description": "This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the symbol of sleep instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6Ã—10 minutes. Unlike with the sleep spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of sleep has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of sleep simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. Note:Magic traps such as symbol of sleep are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of sleep and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for symbol of sleep. Material Component:Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp. ",

    "description": "You bring forth the subject's inner sins and crimes, causing them to manifest in its appearance and aura. Your successful touch attack leaves a mystical mark upon the subject. After a number of rounds equal to your divine caster level, the subject is entitled to a Will save. Success ends the spell at that point, but failure renders the mark of sin permanent. Though the mark is invisible, all living creatures can sense its presence and are repulsed by it. Thus, they begin their initial interactions with the subject one step nearer to a hostile attitude than they normally would, unless they already know the subject personally. Furthermore, the subject takes a -10 circumstance penalty on all Diplomacy checks designed to change the attitudes of others. (See Diplomacy, PH 71). In addition, the subject takes a -4 penalty to a specific ability score based on your deity, as given in the table for the divine retribution spell (page 119). This penalty cannot be removed in any way as long as the mark of sin remains, if you do not worship a deity, you must choose one whose alignment is within one step of your own when you cast this spell for the first time. This choice is for the purpose of this effect only, and you cannot subsequently change it unless your ] alignment shifts in such a way that your previous choice is no longer applicable. A mark of sin cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish,miracle, remove curse,or wish spell. Remove curse works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than that of the mark of sin. ",

The subject retains whatever outlook, allegiances, and outlooks it had before, so long as they do not conflict with the new alignment. Otherwise, it acts with its new selfish, bloodthirsty, cruel outlook on all things. For example, a wizard might not immediately turn on her fighter companion for no apparent reason, particularly in the middle of a combat when they're fighting on the same side. But she might try to steal the fighter's bag of gems, even using applicable spells (charm person, suggestion, and invisibility, for instance) against her friend. She might even eventually decide to betray or attack her friend if there is some potential gain involved. Using this spell in conjunction with a spell such as dominate person or suggestion is particularly useful, because it changes what acts are against a subject's nature.
