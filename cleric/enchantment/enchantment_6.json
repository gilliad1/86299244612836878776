    "description": "This spell functions similarly to lesser geas, except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw. Instead of taking penalties to ability scores (as with lesser geas), the subject takes 3d6 points of damage each day it does not attempt to follow the geas/quest. Additionally, each day it must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened. These effects end 24 hours after the creature attempts to resume the geas/quest. A remove curse spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. Break enchantment does not end a geas/quest, but limited wish, miracle, and wish do. Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as geas, while clerics call the same spell quest. ",

If, for example, a community is hunting for an unknown murderer, they will assume that the subject of the spell is guilty of the crime.

    "description": "This spell eliminates normal inhibitions and silences the subject's conscience. Under its effects, a good creature might commit acts of extraordinary evil without any feelings of remorse. For instance, a paladin who strives to never destroy a foe that has surrendered might decide that she's better off meting out justice immediately and killing the enemy. This spell affects the target's norms and expections; for example, once affected, a good-aligned target might be willing to attack his friends when urged to do so through a suggestion. This would not eliminate his need to atone, according to the tenets and punishments prescribed by his faith or law. The compulsion is permanent until broken by a break enchantment spell or similar magic, or until it is removed by the spellcaster. Material Component:One piece of masterwork artwork of at least 1,000 gp in value. The artwork must depict acts of debauchery or evil that are titillating and fascinating, not disturbing or revolting. The spell is cast upon the artwork, which is then revealed to the subject of the spell, triggering its effects. The enchantment on the artwork lasts for 1 day per spellcaster level, much like a symbol, until it is viewed and its magical effect is triggered. ",
