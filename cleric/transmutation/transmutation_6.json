    "description": "You grant the subject infernal power by transforming its blood into the blood of a demon. The subject gains the fiendish template and the chaotic and evil subtypes, and it becomes chaotic evil if it is not already. The creature counts as an outsider for the purpose of spells and effects that affect only certain creature types. However, any effect that banishes, binds, or sends away outsiders does not function against the subject; instead, it simply causes demonic blood infusion to end immediately. When the spell ends, all its effects terminate immediately, and the target is nauseated for 1d4 rounds. Repeated use of this spell tends to corrupt the target and force it to become chaotic evil if it was not already. Each time demonic blood infusion is cast upon a creature it must attempt a Will saving throw. Failure means the subject becomes chaotic if it was not already. If the subject is chaotic but nonevil, failure causes it to become evil. Each time the spell is used against the same creature, the DC for this saving throw increases by 1. Demonic blood infusion was invented by the followers of Orcus, who use it to boost the power of their church's mortal servants. Material Component: A vial of demon's blood worth 100 gp. ",
