    "description": "With a flash of red light, you invest the target with infernal energy, drawing power from a horned devil to fuel the spell. This spell infuses a creature with the terrible essence of a horned devil. Whenever the subject successfully strikes another living creature with the first melee attack that it makes in a round, the struck creature must succeed on a Will save against the spell's DC or be stunned for 1 round. In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the horned devil). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone. ",

    "description": "You transform a single melee weapon, thrown weapon, or group of projectiles into a weapon of brilliant energy. A brilliant energy weapon sheds light as a torch (20-foot radius) and ignore nonliving matter. Armor bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply). A brilliant energy weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, or objects. If this spell is cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the effect on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target.

The spell rids the creature of noticeable flaws, makes its fur or scales appear shinier, and so forth.

If the target has an Intelligence of 2 or less, the spell imbues the target with an Intelligence of 3. As an axiomatic creature, the target gains the following special attack:Smite Chaos (Su): Once per day, the target can make a normal attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD total (maximum +20) against a chaotic opponent. The target gains the following special quality:Linked Minds (Ex): The target can communicate telepathically with other axiomatic creatures of its type within 300 feet. If one in the group is not flat-footed, none of them are, and no axiomatic creature in the group is considered flanked unless they all are. The target also gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet, spell resistance equal to double its HD (maximum 25), and resistance to cold, electricity, fire, and sonic attacks based on its HD, as shown below:Material Component: A diamond wand worth at least 10,000 gp.

    "description": "The construct touched gains the magic immunity special quality of a particular golem, chosen at the time of casting.  The construct's body becomes covered in a thin skin of clay, flesh, iron, or stone (depending on the type of golem immunity chosen), and it gains immunity to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.  In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the construct, depending on the type of golem immunity conferred by the spell. \nClay: A move earth spell drives the construct back 120 feet and deals 3d12 points of damage to it.  A disintegrate spell slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage.  An earthquake spell cast directly at the construct stops it from moving on its next turn and deals 5d10 points of damage.  The construct gets no saving throw against any of these effects. \nAny magical attack against the construct that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal.  If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.  The construct gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal acid damage. \nFlesh: A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any slow effect on the construct and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal.  If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.  The construct gets no saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage. \nIron: A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the construct and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal.  If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.  The construct gets no saving throw against fire effects.  The construct is affected as an iron construct by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell, regardless of its original composition. \nStone: A transmute rock to mud spell slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock acts as a total repair spell.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the construct's structure but negates its immunity to magic for 1 full round. ",

This Abyssal heritor feat replaces one feat of the subject's choice that it already possesses. The replaced feat need not have been an Abyssal heritor feat.
