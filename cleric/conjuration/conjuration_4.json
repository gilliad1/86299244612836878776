The spell must be cast so that it rests on a solid surface.  Once cast, the wall is immobile.  The sand is sufficiently thick to block ranged attacks, providing normal cover appropriate for its size, but creatures can attempt to force their way through it.  Moving through a wall of sand is difficult, requiring a full-round action and a Strength check.  A creature moves 5 feet through a wall of sand for every 5 points by which its Strength check result exceeds 10. \nCreatures within a wall of sand are considered blinded and deafened, and they are unable to speak or breathe.  Thus, they might begin to suffocate (DMG 304) if they remain within the wall too long.  Spells with verbal components cannot be cast within the wall, and any other spell requires a successful Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). \nCreatures with reach can attempt to attack through the wall, but targets have total concealment and total cover, and the attacker must have a general idea where the target is located. \nAny open, unprotected flame thrust into a wall of sand is instantly extinguished. \nArcane Material Component: A handful of sand.

    "description": "This spell creates a gleaming wall of salt crystal that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. The wall can seal off a passage or breach, or be used to construct new walls. A wall of salt is 1 inch thick per caster level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. You can form a wall of salt into nearly any shape desired. The wall need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm or as a ramp. If such a span is more than 20 feet long, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell's area by half. For example, a 10th-level caster could create a salt span with a surface area of five 5-foot squares. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth, by likewise reducing the area. The wall can be destroyed normally by a disintegrate spell or by chipping and breaking. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 3 hit points per inch and hardness 2. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 1 per inch of thickness. Directing a constant blast of water at a wall of salt (for example, a geyser from a decanter of endless water) dissolves the mineral, dealing 10 points of damage per minute (which hardness does not reduce). It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of salt, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves. Arcane Material Component: A crystal of rock salt. ",
