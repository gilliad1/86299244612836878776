Otherwise, the aspect appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the aspect (it understands Celestial, Common, and Draconic), you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions before the duration elapses.

    "description": "With this spell, you place a magic trap on any object that casts a shadow. If the object is disturbed in any way that causes its shadow to shift (for instance, if it or a nearby light source is moved), a bound greater shadow (see Monster Manual page 221) emerges from the object's shadow to attack the nearest living creature. The shadow can be turned or destroyed as normal; otherwise, it remains for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. If the trapped object resides in a place that has no shadows, the trap does not trigger, although the spell remains in effect.

Once the item is transmuted, you must give it willingly to a creature and at the same time inform it of a command word to be spoken when the item is used. To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard action). When this is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and carrying (to a maximum of the character's heavy load) are instantly transported to your abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar that is touching the subject). You can alter the spell when casting it so that it transports you to within 10 feet of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word spoken. You will have a general idea of the location and situation of the item possessor at the time the refuge spell is discharged, but once you decide to alter the spell in this fashion, you have no choice whether or not to be transported.
