The words of your loving declaration call forth a silver-white glow around your target that swiftly fades. \nThis spell instills in the target an obsessive fascination with the moon.  If the target fails its save, it fixates on the moon, staring at the moon or imagining it in its mind, and is considered fascinated for the duration of the spell. \nIf the saving throw is successful, the subject is instead dazzled for the duration of the spell. \nSightless creatures are not affected by this spell. \nFocus: A silver ingot worth 5 gp.
