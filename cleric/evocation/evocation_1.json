    "description": "You invoke the powers of good and you begin to glow with the silver light of fabled Lunia, the first layer of the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia. \nThe silvery radiance created by this spell emanates from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light extends for an additional 30 feet. \nBeginning one turn after you cast this spell, you can choose to expend some or all of the light of Lunia as a ray of light.  You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.  You can make a single ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, or 2d6 points of damage against undead or evil outsiders, with a range of 30 feet.  Spell resistance applies to this attack.  This dims your silvery radiance to half (15-foot light, with dim light for an additional 15 feet).  You can choose to fire one additional ray with the same characteristics either on the same round or on a subsequent round.  Firing the second ray quenches your radiance and ends the spell. ",
