Where it lands the dust sparkles and evaporates, and the elemental region around you calms and becomes more hospitable. \nThis spell creates an area around the subject creature that emulates its native planar environment.  Thus, a character hailing from the Material Plane would have normal gravity, temperature, magic, and so on.  This spell cast on a native of the Plane of Shadow (DMG 152) would make the area around the creature mimic its home plane's normal gravity, a mild neutral alignment, enhanced shadow spells, and impeded light or fire spells. \nArcane Material Component: A sprinkling of silver dust.

Any creature within or entering the field must attempt a save. If it fails, it becomes unable to move toward you for the duration of the spell. Repelled creatures' actions are not otherwise restricted. They can fight other creatures and can cast spells and attack you with ranged weapons. If you move closer to an affected creature, nothing happens. (The creature is not forced back). The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come within reach. If a repelled creature moves away from you and then tries to turn back toward you, it cannot move any closer if it is still within the spell's area.
