    "description": "As you finish chanting the words, a pearlescent film covers your body before fading into your skin, a pale rainbow of colors offering their protection against potential damage to come. \nThis spell functions similarly to contingency (PH 213), but with a more limited scope.  While contingent energy resistance is in effect, if you are dealt damage associated with one of the five types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the spell automatically grants you resistance 10 against that type of energy for up to 10 minutes per caster level, or until the remainder of the spell's duration, just as if you were under the effect of a resist energy spell of the appropriate type. \nOnce the energy type protected against by a particular casting of this spell is determined, it can't be changed.  You can't have more than one contingent energy resistance in effect on yourself at the same timeâ€”if you cast the spell a second time while an earlier casting is still in effect, the earlier spell automatically expires. \nThe energy resistance granted by this spell does not stack with similar benefits against the same energy type (such as from the resist energy spell).  However, it is possible to be simultaneously under the effect of resist energy (fire) and contingent energy resistance (electricity), or any other two such spells that protect against different types of energy. \nMaterial Component: An oyster shell.

A fang trap is usually cast on a specific spot, such as a doorway or an area of floor. It can be set to distinguish between humans and Scaled Ones, or between beings wearing particular items and those who are not. The trigger can't be a symbol, but it may be one or more specific items (for example, \"six metal rings on digits, no more and no less\"). When a fang trap discharges, the subject is held immobile for 1 round. A successful Fortitude saving throw frees the subject after that period without further effect.
