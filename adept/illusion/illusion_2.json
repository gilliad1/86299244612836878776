    "description": "The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision.  If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too.  If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. \nItems dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature.  Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source).  Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope. \nOf course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).  The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature.  For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe.  (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions).  Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell.  Causing harm indirectly is not an attack.  Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth.  If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.  Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.  See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat. \nInvisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell. \nArcane Material Component: An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.

By casting this spell, you cause the subject to believe that one ally and one enemy have traded places. The ally physically closest to the subject now seems to have the appearance, voice, clothing, and gear of its nearest enemy, and that enemy looks and sounds exactly like the subject's nearest ally.

    "description": "Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck. Mirror image creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total). These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you. You can move into and through a mirror image. When you and the mirror image separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on. Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against an image destroys it. An image's AC is 10 + your sizemodifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they're burned or dead after being hit by a fireball). While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded. An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded). ",
