The closest targets are selected first until no more targets within range can be affected.  For example, if Vadania affects 7 HD worth of animals and there are several 2 HD wolves within close range, only the three closest wolves are affected. \nA magical beast, a dire animal, or an animal trained to attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; an animal not trained to attack or guard is not. \nSpecial: When casting animal trance as a Scalykind Domain spell, only ophidian and reptilian creatures are affected.
