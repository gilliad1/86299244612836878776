The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level. You must succeed on an appropriate skill check to make a complex item, such as Craft (bowmaking) check to make straight arrow shafts. Attempting to use any created object as a material component causes the spell to fail. Material Component: A tiny piece of matter of the same sort of item you plan to create with minor creation—a bit of twisted hemp to create rope, and so forth. ",
