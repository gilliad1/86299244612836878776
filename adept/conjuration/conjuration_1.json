    "description": "A misty vapor arises around you.  It is stationary once created.  The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.  A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance).  Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). \nA moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds.  A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.  A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area.  A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.  This spell does not function underwater. ",
