    "description": "You create one twinkling star per level (maximum ten stars). These minute starbursts orbit your head like ioun stones. As a swift action, you can launch one star at a target you designate within range. Alternatively, as a standard action, you can launch up to three stars at one or more targets within range. You can only launch stars once per round. You must make a ranged touch attack for each star. Against non-evil targets, each star deals 1d8 points of nonlethal damage; evil targets take 1d8 points of lethal damage instead. ",
