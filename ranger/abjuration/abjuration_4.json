    "description": "The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, and detect spells.  Nondetection also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls.  If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast nondetection.  If you cast nondetection on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level. \nIf cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself. \nMaterial Component: A pinch of diamond dust worth 50 gp.
