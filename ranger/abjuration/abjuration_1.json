    "description": "This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.  The subject gains energy resistance 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit points.  The value of the energy resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level.  The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.  \nResist energy absorbs only damage.  The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as drowning in acid (since drowning damage comes from lack of oxygen) or becoming encased in ice. \nNote: Resist energy overlaps (and does not stack with) protection from energy. If a character is warded by protection from energy and resist energy, the protection spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted. ",

A few spoken phrases, backed by magical power, and that oppression seems to lift. \nThis abjuration grants a creature limited protection from a plane's alignment traits (DMG 149).  When the subject visits a plane with an alignment trait, this spell grants it immunity to penalties on its Charisma-based checks that mildly aligned planes impose on visitors of opposed alignments.  The Charisma-, Wisdom-, and Intelligence based check penalties associated with strongly aligned planes are halved while the spell's duration lasts. ",

A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm.

You note a single mental \"ping\" that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration.  A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm. \nAudible Alarm: An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly.  Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.  In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away.  The sound lasts for 1 round.  Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the ringing. \nEthereal or astral creatures do not trigger the alarm. \nAlarm can be made permanent with a permanency spell. \nArcane Focus: A tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver wire.
