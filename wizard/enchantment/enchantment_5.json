    "description": "This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the symbol of sleep instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6Ã—10 minutes. Unlike with the sleep spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of sleep has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of sleep simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. Note:Magic traps such as symbol of sleep are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of sleep and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for symbol of sleep. Material Component:Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp. ",

It flies at a speed of 30 feet per round (perfect maneuverability), and you can concentrate on controlling its every movement or specify a simple program. Directing the vortex's movement is a move action, while changing its programmed movement is a standard action. If you don't move or program the vortex, it merely stays at rest, spinning and howling. The vortex dissipates if it exceeds the spell's range. If the sleep mote enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and causes a magical slumber to come upon any creature whose space it completely engulfs that fails a Will saving throw (thus, creatures larger than Medium size have immunity to a sleep mote). Even on a successful Will saving throw, affected creatures are sleepy, and take a -2 penalty on all Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma checks for the spell's duration. Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). Sleep mote has no effect on unconscious creatures. Arcane Material Component: A pinch of fine sand and a live cricket. ",

The target creature must make another saving throw each round or be affected by the suggestion, acting out the specified course of action for up to 1 hour per caster level or until the action is completed (as per the suggestion spell). \nSpecial: Gnome spellcasters cast this spell at +1 caster level. \nMindset: The energies you manipulate while preparing this spell enhance your force of personality, granting you a +2 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.

    "description": "You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind. If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as \"Come here\", \"Go there\", \"Fight\", and \"Stand still\". You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description, page 81). Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action. By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth). Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it. If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination. Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it.
