    "description": "The ancient words are no sooner spoken than you behold the twinkling fire within the dragon's eyes flare into a conflagration. This spell fuels the Dracorage for a short period. It causes the target to instantly and fully succumb to the Dracorage, shifting the target's attitude toward nondragons to hostile and instilling in the dragon a bloodthirsty desire to murder and wreak havoc. This usually causes the dragon (even a good metallic dragon) to immediately attack all nondragons nearby. Because aggravate Dracorage manipulates the existing Dracorage mythal, the Will save against the spell is 4 higher than normal and has a DC of 18 + the appropriate ability modifier. (Nevertheless, many casters of the spell will use subterfuge to trick the target dragon into allowing the spell to be cast freely upon it, thereby avoiding the dragon's high Will save bonus). As with the Dracorage mythal itself, this spell ignores a dragon's spell resistance. Aggravate Dracorage functions only during the period of the Dracorage and has no effect on dragons at other times. This spell counters or dispels abate Dracorage. Origin: As part of his research to control the Dracorage mythal, Sammaster (the once-human lich) crafted aggravate Dracorage and shared it with his most loyal minions. ",

The creature must have 7 or fewer Hit Dice and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity. The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions (such as \"Wait here\" or \"Defend this area against attack\"), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions: For example, if you order the recipient to protect you from all harm, it might place you in a nice, safe dungeon for the duration of the spell. If the subject is prevented from obeying the lesser geas for 24 hours, it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of â€“ 8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the lesser geas. A lesser geas (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish. Dispel magic does not affect a lesser geas. ",

The target will only fight if someone actively attempts to prevent it from following through with its search for the ocean; if this fight is with an ally, the target is granted a second saving throw to throw off the effects of the spell. In some environments, this means that those affected simply flee in the direction of the nearest coast. Along a shoreline, targets often plunge into the surf. Aboard ship, they leap overboard.
