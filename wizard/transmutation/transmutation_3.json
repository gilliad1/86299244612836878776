The chosen effect covers the entire area of the spell; multiple effects may not be applied to different areas. The possible effects are described below. Deepen Darkness and Shadow:Normal shadows now grant a +4 bonus on Hide checks and provide concealment to creatures within them. Magical darkness now confers total concealment to anyonewithin its area. Lighten Darkness and Shadow:Normal shadows are suppressed within the area, making it impossible to hide within them or use abilities such as the shadowdancer's shadow jump ability. Magical darkness no longer provides concealment, and thearea can now be illuminated by any light source. Move Shadow: The affected shadow moves as you direct within the area. You can create shadow illusions (as those created by a silent image spell, but without color), reveal hidden creatures bytaking their shadow away, cause shadows to follow you within the area of the spell, or otherwise move the shadow as you see fit. You cannot move areas of darkness in this way. ",

    "description": "Like a blink dog (see the Monster Manual), you \"blink\" back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. You look as though you're winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random. Blinking has several effects, as follows. Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment). If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance). Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike. Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane. While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC. You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material. While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material). Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones. For instance, your spells against ethereal creatures are 20% likely to activate just as you go material and be lost. An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects (such as magic missile and wall of force) and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as the basilisk and its gaze attack. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material. ",

The Celestial Hebdomad, the rulers of the Seven Heavens, subsist entirely on ambrosia. The caster draws ambrosia from the target and contains it within a tiny receptacle, such as a vial. Ambrosia can only be drawn from a blissful creature; how the creature achieves this state of bliss can vary from one individual to the next. For example, distilled joy can be cast on a deliriously lovestruck character, a dryad dreaming near her tree, an artist crafting his life's masterpiece, or a character experiencing a moment of rapture or undiluted sexual pleasure. Good spellcasters can use ambrosia in magic item creation. Each dose provides the equivalent of 2 experience points needed to create the item. A dose of ambrosia can also be used as an optional spell component (see Chapter 3). A living creature that drinks a dose of ambrosia experiences a soothing sensation that wipes away minor aches and pains, takes the edge off grief and sadness, and cures 1 point of damage. These positive sensations and emotions persist for 1d4+1 hours. Focus: A vial or similar container in which to contain the ambrosia. ",
