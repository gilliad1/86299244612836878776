You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell. \nThe rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it—it does not snake outward—so it must be thrown near the intended target.

    "description": "This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature's size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size. A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target's speed. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it—the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage (see Table 2-2 in the Dungeon Master's Guide). Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell—an enlarged +1 sword still has only a +1 enhancement bonus, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, and so on. Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of a humanoid that's still under the effect of the first casting.

You point your finger at the target across the room, and it slowly rises in the air. \nA greater mage hand spell can lift an object and move it at will from a distance.  As a move action, you can propel the target up to 20 feet in any direction, although the spell ends if the distance between you and the subject ever exceeds the spell's range. \nA creature can negate the effect against an object it possesses with a successful Will save or if you fail to overcome its spell resistance. \nAn object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand.  For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation.  The spell has an effective Strength of 10. ",

You can continue to use your aberrant dragonmark spell-like abilities as normal. \nIf you have a base aberrant dragonmark, you can reshape it into the form of any least true dragonmark.  If you have a lesser or greater aberrant dragonmark, you can reshape it into a lesser or greater true dragonmark, respectively. \nThis spell taxes the body.
