You have an arcane spell failure chance of 50% and a -8 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments. Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.

This effect works exactly like a targeted dispel magic cast by the creator of the blackstaff.

Blackstaff may be cast upon any nonmagical quarterstaff or on a magic staff in the caster's possession.

If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.  The construct gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal acid damage. \nFlesh: A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows the construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any slow effect on the construct and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal.

Transferring to another plane of existence requires 1d4 hours on Dream (which corresponds to 1d4Ã—6 minutes as time is measured on most other planes). Any creatures touched by you when dream travel is cast also makes the transition to the borders of unconscious thought.
