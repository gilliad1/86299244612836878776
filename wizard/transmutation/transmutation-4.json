    "description": "With a flash of red light and a sound like the screams of a thousand suffering souls, you invest the target with infernal energy, drawing power from an amnizu to power the spell. You infuse a target with the intellect-sapping power and slippery mind of an amnizu. While under the effect of this spell, the target can, each round as a standard action, make a single melee touch attack. A touched creature takes 1d4 points of Intelligence damage. The subject of this spell can use this touch attack once per two caster levels. The subject of this spell also becomes immune to any effect that would damage, drain, or otherwise reduce its own Intelligence score. In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the amnizu). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone. ",

    "description": "With the sound of flapping wings, you grant the target the power of an erinyes. The target gains the sinister allure of an erinyes. While the spell is in effect, the subject can beckon a creature it can see clearly, forcing it to approach unless the creature succeeds on a Will save against the spell's save DC. On a failed save, the creature can do nothing on its next action except to attempt to move closer to the subject of investiture of the erinyes. The beckoned creature will not take obviously suicidal actions, such as walking off the edge of a cliff. However, it will move normally through squares threatened by other creatures. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. Once the beckoned creature enters an adjacent square, or if it was already in an adjacent square, it takes no further action that round. The subject of this spell can use this effect once per three caster levels. In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5.

This spell adds a touch of good to your magic, granting you special potency against your evil-aligned enemies. Your spells gain the good descriptor. Any spell you cast of 3rd level or lower deals +50% damage to evil-aligned creatures. As part of the casting of this spell, you can sacrifice one sorcerer spell slot of 5th to 9th level; doing this increases the maximumlevel of spells affected by mark of the enlightened soul to the level of the sacrificed slot minus 1. For example, if you spend a 4th-level spell slot to cast the spell and a 7th-level spell slot to augment it, you would deal extra damage to evil-aligned creatures with spells of 6th level or lower. Special: A good-aligned caster of the dragonblood subtype can choose to end this spell's duration by activating protection from evil (as the spell, but targeting itself) as a swift action. This effect lasts for the normal duration of protection from evil. ",
