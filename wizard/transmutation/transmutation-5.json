    "description": "This spell turns normal water (or watery solutions) into a frothy substance that is as breathable as air. Both air-breathing and water-breathing creatures within the area can breathe normally. Moving through airy water is easier than moving through normal water. Swimmers make a DC 10 Swim check once per round; they swim at their normal speed on a success, or half their normal speed on a failure. Creatures with a swim speed can simply use their swim speed without penalty. Creatures can instead use their land speed to move along the bottom at their normal speed. Creatures walking on the bottom do not pay any movement penalty for walking on sand, stone, or pebble seafloor and only pay 2 squares of movement per square of muck or mud entered (see Marine Dungeon Terrain on page 21). Finally, airy water negates underwater combat penalties for all melee attacks, although ranged attacks still take the normal underwater penalty. The spell does not filter or purify solid particles, so casting airy water on very turbid liquids, for example, would produce an area filled with dust or smoke (and impose similar penalties). Material Component: A small handful of alkaline salts. ",

    "description": "A number of animals grow to twice their normal size and eight times their normal weight.  This alteration changes each animal's size category to the next largest (from Large to Huge, for example), grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a -2 size penalty to Dexterity.  The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2.  The size change also affects the animal's modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage, as detailed on Table 2-2 in the Dungeon Master's Guide.  The animal's space and reach change as indicated on Table 8-4: Creature Size and Scale (page 149), but its speed does not change. \nThe spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. \nSpecial: When casting animal growth as a Scalykind Domain spell, only ophidian and reptilian creatures are affected. \nIf insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process.  If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it—the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size. \nAll equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.  Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size. \nThe spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals. \nMultiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of an animal that's still under the effect of the first casting.

It can write in the languages it understands, but only the form is capable of writing in some manner (such as drawing in the dirt with a paw). \n\nWith those exceptions, the target's normal game statistics are replaced by those of the new form.  The target loses all the special abilities it has in its normal form, including its class features. \nAll items worn or carried by the subject fall to the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn or carried by the new form. \nIf the new form would prove fatal to the creature (for example, if you polymorphed a landbound target into a fish, or an airborne target into a toad), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save. \nIf the subject remains in the new form for 24 consecutive hours, it must attempt a Will save.  If this save fails, it loses its ability to understand language, as well as all other memories of its previous form, and its Hit Dice and hit points change to match an average creature of its new form.  These abilities and statistics return to normal if the effect is later ended. \nIncorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to baleful polymorph, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action (which ends the spell's effect).

    "description": "Like the 3rd-level arcane spell blink, you flicker back and forth between the Material and Ethereal planes. However, you are capable of controlling the timing of you blinks and therefore make better use of them. Blinking by means of this spell has several effects: Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help the attacker. If the attack is capable of striking invisible or incorporeal creatures, the miss chance is only 20%. An attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures takes no penalty. You have no chance of interfering with your own attacks. Individually targeted spells have a 50% chance to fail against you while blinking, unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. You have no chance of interfering with your own spells. You take only half damage from area attacks (or full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). While blinking, you strike as an invisible creature (+2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC. You take only half damage from falling, since you are subject to gravity only while you are on the Material Plane. You can ready an action to blink away from a specific enemy attack, physical or magical. If you do so, the attack misses automatically unless it can also affect ethereal targets. You move at three-quarters speed, since movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.

The tentacle does not interfere with spellcasting in any way. \nOnce each round as a free action, you can have the tentacle attack a creature up to 10 feet away with its bite attack, and if it successfully hits, the tentacle can use the snake's improved grab ability to deal damage through constriction. \nIn each round when the gutsnake is constricting a target, you cannot move more than 5 feet away from that target, unless the gutsnake makes a successful grapple check to carry the opponent with you when you move (see PH 155 for grappling rules).  This is the only way in which the tentacle restricts movement.  While the snake is present, you can use its Balance and Climb skill modifiers instead of your own, and you gain a climb speed of 20 feet. \nFocus: A fang from any reptile. ",

    "description": "Like the 3rd-level arcane spell blink, you flicker back and forth between the Material and Ethereal planes. However, you are capable of controlling the timing of your blinks and therefore make better use of them. Blinking by means of this spell has several effects: Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help the attacker. If the attack is capable of striking invisible or incorporeal creatures, the miss chance is only 20%. An attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures takes no penalty. You have no chance of interfering with your own attacks. Individually targeted spells have a 50% chance to fail against you while blinking, unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. You have no chance of interfering with your own spells. You take only half damage from area attacks (or full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). While blinking, you strike as an invisible creature (+2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC. You take only half damage from falling, since you are subject to gravity only while you are on the Material Plane. You can ready an action to blink away from a specific enemy attack, physical or magical. If you do so, the attack misses automatically unless it canalso affect ethereal targets. You move at three-quarters speed, since movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed and you spend about half your time there and half your time material. While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. You do not risk materializing inside a solid object unless you actually end your move inside one, in which case you materialize and are shunted off to the nearest open space. You take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet traveled in this manner. Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures in roughly the same way you interact with material ones (their attacks have a 50% miss chance against you, and so on). ",
