    "description": "An invisible barrier surrounds a single creature and its equipment. The target creature is impervious to most magical effects including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines, thus preventing the target from casting spells or using spell-like abilities or magic items for the duration. An antimagic aura suppresses any spell or magical effect used on or by, or cast onto, the target, but does not dispel it. A charmed creature, for example, is not charmed while affected by the aura, but the spell resumes functioning when antimagic aura ends. Time spent within an antimagic aura counts against the suppressed spell's duration. Material Component: A pinch of powdered iron or iron filings. ",

The target, if struck, functions as if it were inside an antimagic field (PH 200) if it fails its Will save. \nIf this spell is used against a creature, the subject can't cast spells or use supernatural or spell-like abilities, nor do such abilities have any effect on the creature.  However, the creature can still use spell completion items (such as scrolls) or spell trigger items (such as wands), even though it can't cast the spells required. \nIf this spell is used against an object, that object's magical powers are suppressed—including any spells previously cast and currently in effect on the item, as well as any spells or magical effects targeted on the object during the antimagic ray's duration. \nThe spell doesn't affect any objects other than the subject itself, even if those objects are worn, carried by, or in contact with the subject.  For instance, if a creature is the target, its equipment remains unaffected. \nMaterial Component: A pinch of iron filings mixed with ruby dust worth 100 gp. ",

    "description": "A banishment spell is a more powerful version of the dismissal spell.  It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane.  As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be banished.  You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes.  For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target's spell resistance (if any), the saving throw DC increases by 2.  For example, if this spell were cast on a demon that hated light and was vulnerable to holy water and cold iron weapons, you might use iron, holy water, and a torch in the spell.  The three items would give you a +3 bonus on your check to overcome the demon's spell resistance and add 6 to the spell's save DC. \nAt the DM's option, certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a +2 bonus on the caster level check against spell resistance and increasing the save DC by 4). \nArcane Focus: Any item that is distasteful to the subject (optional, see above).

The DM secretly rolls the exact number.  When a spell is turned, the DM subtracts its level from the amount of spell turning left.  \nWhen you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned.  The subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through.

You would take one-forth of the damage, while the caster takes three-fourths of the damage.
