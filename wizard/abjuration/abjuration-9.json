    "description": "Spells and spell-like effects that target you are absorbed, their energy stored to power spells of your own.  Absorption absorbs only ranged spells that have you as a target.  Touch spells, effect spells, and area spells that affect you cannot be absorbed. \nOnce the spell is cast, you can absorb 1d4+6 spell levels (rolled secretly by the DM).  The level of each spell you absorb is subtracted from the total.  If a spell is only partially absorbed (because its level exceeds the number of levels remaining to be absorbed), divide the number of spell levels left unabsorbed by the original spell level.  For spells that deal damage, use the result to determine what fraction of the damage you take.  For spells that create effects, use the result as a percentage chanceto be affected. \nFor example, you have three spell levels of absorption remaining and are struck by dominate person cast as a 5th-level spell.  Absorption absorbs three levels of the spell, resulting in a 40% chance (2/5) that you will be affected normally.  If affected, any saving throw the spell allows you still applies.  Likewise, if you're struck by disintegrate cast as a 6th-level spell with four levels of absorption remaining, two levels of the spell remain, and you take only 33% (1/3) of the damage you would normally take from the spell. \nYou can use captured spell energy to cast any spell you know or have prepared, but spells so cast don't disappear from your list of prepared spells or count against the number of spells you can normally cast per day (so you so must keep a running total of spell levels absorbed and used).  The levels of spell energy you have stored must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell you want to cast, and you must have at hand (and expend) any material components required for the spell.

These spheres appear in a spiral above your head or around your body and follow you up to 60 feet per round. The spheres intercept incoming hostile magic, negating spells or spell-like abilities that would affect you or that have an effect that extends into your space. One sphere is expended for each spell level of the effect negated, so a slay living spell (Clr 5) would expend five spheres. In the case of area effect spells, it negates the whole spell. If not enough spheres exist to negate an incoming effect, the spheres remain and the effect works as normal. You may move one or more spheres up to 60 feet as a standard action. If not sent to another area, the spheres default to following you. If you exceed their range, they remain behind and function normally at that location. The spheres have no physical substance, do not provide cover or concealment, and conform to narrow spaces up to 6 inches in diameter without altering their ability to function. They cannot pass through solid objects or force effects. They cannot be harmed by physical or magical attacks except those that dispel or negate magic entirely (such as dispel magic, antimagic field, and so on). ",

    "description": "Bringing to your lips some of the most elemental words of arcane power, you feel stirring within you the spirits of ancient mages as you prepare to absorb the spell energies you have targeted.  Your body shakes uncontrollably, as if eagerly anticipating the power behind those spells. \nThis spell functions like dispel magic (PH 223), except that your caster level for your dispel check is a maximum of +20 instead of +10, and (as with greater dispel magic) you have a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can't dispel that effect.  When casting a targeted dispel or counterspell, you can choose to reave each spell you successfully dispel, stealing its power and effect for yourself.  When making a targeted dispel, make a Spellcraft check (DC 25 + spell level) to identify the target spell or each ongoing spell currently in effect on the target creature or object.  \nEach spell you dispel with a targeted dispel can be reaved if you so desire, and the spell's effects are redirected to you, continuing as if cast on you by the original caster with no interruption to or extension of duration.  Once you reave the spell, you identify it if you haven't done so already (see below).  If the subject was the caster and the spell is dismissible, you can dismiss it as if you had cast it yourself.  Likewise, if the subject was the caster and the spell requires concentration, you must concentrate to maintain the spell's effect as if you had cast it yourself. \nYou can still attempt to reave a spell you didn't identify with your Spellcraft check, but doing so can be risky if you don't know the specifics of the spell's effect.  For example, if you fail to identity an ongoing spell effect on an enemy character and choose to reave anyway, you might find yourself under the influence of the dominate person effect that character was suffering from.  Any spell resistance you might have has no effect against harmful spells you might inadvertently reave, but you get the same chance to save against those spell effects as the original target. \nIf you choose to reave a spell you have successfully counterspelled with reaving dispel, you seize control of the spell after the enemy caster completes it, and you can redirect the spell to whatever targets or area you wish (including the original caster, if appropriate).  Again, you must make a Spellcraft check (DC 25 + spell level) to identify the spell you intend to reave, but you are free to choose to redirect a spell whose effect, range, and area you don't know.  If the redirected spell's correct casting conditions aren't met (because you guess at an improper target or range, for example), the spell fails. \nReaving dispel can be used to cast an area dispel with the increased maximum caster level, but any magical effects so dispelled cannot be reaved.

When a spell is cast, you can visually observe its effects on the Weave. Thanks to this heightened understanding, you can use the counterspell action to do much more than merely counter another caster's spell. Srinshee's spell shift grants you a +4 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify spells for counterspelling. Furthermore, instead of simply negating the effect of a spell you successfully counter, you can choose from among the following options as long as Srinshee's spell shift lasts. Aid: You can boost the effectiveness of an ally's spell by applying any one metamagic feat from the following list: Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Maximize Spell, or Widen Spell. To use this option, you must expend a spell slot (or sacrifice a prepared spell) whose spell level equals or exceeds that of the ally's spell with the desired metamagic feat applied. For example, empowering an ally's fireball would require you to expend a 5th-level or higher spell slot. Manipulate: You can seize control of the spell's range, area, or targets, as appropriate, and reshape these factors as you choose. For example, you could cause an enemy wizard's fireball to explode at his feet, or you could cause his haste spell to target your allies within the area he has specified. Only one property of the spell, chosen from among those that the caster can normally designate, can be manipulated in this manner. For example, you could not choose the targets of a sleep spell because the targets affected are determined by the spell itself, not the caster. Backlash: You counter the spell as normal, but your opponent must succeed on a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. ",
