Whenever you are exposed to energy damage, a multi-hued aura covers your body and absorbs up to 1d6 points per caster level (maximum 15d6) of whatever type of energy triggered the effect. The protective aura lasts for 1 round or until it absorbs all the damage it can, whichever comes first. Once the aura begins absorbing damage, you cannot change the type of damage it absorbs. Energy buffer overlaps (and does not stack with) endure elements, resist elements, and protection from elements. If you are warded by energy buffer and one or more of the other spells, the energy buffer spell absorbs damage until it is exhausted, no matter what type of energy the other spells ward against. If you are subjected to a second type of energy after energy buffer is activated, any warding spell that protects you from the second type of energy is still effective. For example, Mialee casts energy buffer on herself and also receives protection from elements (fire) and resist elements (cold) from Jozan. Later, a white dragon and a group of ogres ambush Mialee's party. The ogres hurl flasks of alchemist's fire at Mialee, which triggers her energy buffer spell. The buffer easily absorbs all the fire damage Mialee would have suffered, and the protection from elements (fire) spell absorbs nothing. Later, in the surprise round, the white dragon looses its breath weapon. Because Mialee's energy buffer spell is absorbing fire damage, it is ineffective against the cold damage the dragon's breath weapon deals, but Mialee still gets the benefit of the resist elements (cold) spell.

Creatures caught in the current must make a DC 20 Swim check to avoid going under. A creature that fails the Swim check is pulled down to a depth of 10 feet per caster level and must hold its breath or begin to drown (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). The current might capsize vessels: The chance is 95% for a craft shorter than 20 feet long, 50% for one from 20 to 60 feet long, and 20% for one over 60 feet long. Counterspell:Used in this way, dispel water targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (see page 170 of the Player's Handbook). It only counters spells and spell-like abilities that have the water descriptor, or appear on the Water domain spell list, or clearly involve water (such as create food and water, sleet storm, and wall of ice). To successfully counter the other spell, you must make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +20) against a DC equal to 11 + the spell's caster level. Dismiss Water Creature: Cast in this way, dispel water targets a single extraplanar creature of the water subtype within range. The creature can negate the effect with a successful Will save (and its spell resistance, if any, applies). If it fails to save or resist the spell, the creature is forced back to its home plane. ",

For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25. If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. For instance, bestow curse cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, but break enchantment can dispel it. If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, such as a cursed sword, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects. For example, a cursed item can change the alignment of its user. Break enchantment allows the victim to be rid of the item and negates the alignment change, but the item's curse is intact and affects the next creature to pick up the item—even if it's the recent recipient of the break enchantment spell.
