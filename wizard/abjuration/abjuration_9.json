The subject remains there unless a freedom spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a crystal ball, a locate object spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but discern location does. A wish or miracle spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a -4 penalty on its save. ",

However, when you're inside it, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere (including spells).  Other creatures that attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time. \nTypically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe will exist, since you are at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually excluded by the floor surface you are standing on. \nThe colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a prismatic wall. \nPrismatic sphere can be made permanent with a permanency spell. \n\n\nColor \nOrder \nEffect of Color \nNegated By \n\n\n Red \n 1st \n Stops nonmagical ranged weapons.  \n Cone of cold \n\n\n \n \n Deals 20 points of fire damage (Relfex half).  \n \n\n\n Orange \n 2nd \n Stops magical ranged weapons.  \n Gust of wind \n\n\n \n \n Deals 40 points of acid damage (Reflex half).  \n \n\n\n Yellow \n 3rd \n Stops poisons, gases and petrification.  \n Disintegrate \n\n\n \n \n Deals 80 points of electricity damage (Reflex half).  \n \n\n\n Green \n 4th \n Stops breath weapons \n Passwall \n\n\n \n \n Poison (Kills; Fortitude partial for 1d6 points of Con damage instead).  \n \n\n\n Blue \n 5th \n Stops divination and mental attacks.  \n Magic missle \n\n\n \n \n Turned to stone (Fortitude negates).  \n \n\n\n Indigo \n 6th \n Stops all spells.  \n Daylight \n\n\n \n \n Will save or become insane (as insanity spell).  \n \n\n\n Violet \n 7th \n Energy field destroys all objects and effects.  \n Dispel magic \n\n\n \n \n Creatures sent to another plane (Will negates).  \n \n\n\nNote: The violet effect makes the special effects of the other six colors redundant, but these six effects are included here because certain magic items can create prismatic effects one color at a time, and spell resistance might render some colors ineffective (see above).

An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's Will save bonus, whichever is higher. You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an antimagic field. If the antimagic field survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined. Even artifacts are subject to disjunction, though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities.

    "description": "This potent spell opens your senses to the Weave, allowing you to perceive its very fabric as clearly as you might see the trees in a forest while standing in the heart of it. When a spell is cast, you can visually observe its effects on the Weave. Thanks to this heightened understanding, you can use the counterspell action to do much more than merely counter another caster's spell. Srinshee's spell shift grants you a +4 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify spells for counterspelling. Furthermore, instead of simply negating the effect of a spell you successfully counter, you can choose from among the following options as long as Srinshee's spell shift lasts. Aid: You can boost the effectiveness of an ally's spell by applying any one metamagic feat from the following list: Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Maximize Spell, or Widen Spell. To use this option, you must expend a spell slot (or sacrifice a prepared spell) whose spell level equals or exceeds that of the ally's spell with the desired metamagic feat applied. For example, empowering an ally's fireball would require you to expend a 5th-level or higher spell slot. Manipulate: You can seize control of the spell's range, area, or targets, as appropriate, and reshape these factors as you choose. For example, you could cause an enemy wizard's fireball to explode at his feet, or you could cause his haste spell to target your allies within the area he has specified. Only one property of the spell, chosen from among those that the caster can normally designate, can be manipulated in this manner. For example, you could not choose the targets of a sleep spell because the targets affected are determined by the spell itself, not the caster. Backlash: You counter the spell as normal, but your opponent must succeed on a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. ",
