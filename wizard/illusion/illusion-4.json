Creatures in the area move cautiously as they are caught up in the phantom melee. This spell creates the illusion of a fierce battle. Your enemies move cautiously and pass up the opportunity to strike their foes, since the roar and confusion of the battle distracts them. All creatures within the area of the spell that fail their saving throws cannot make attacks of opportunity. In addition, all creatures within the area are considered flanked. A creature ignores these effects when it leaves the spell's area. If a creature reenters the spell's area after leaving it, the creature can attempt another save to resist the spell if its initial save failed. A creature that enters the area for the first time after the spell is cast must also make a saving throw to resist the effect. A phantom battle spell produces noise appropriate to a mob of creatures locked in battle. Anyone in the battle can plainly see that the conjured fighters are no threat, since they strike solely at other phantom warriors, but the din, tumult, and confusion make it difficult to focus on the true foes at hand. A creature that succeeds on its save can still see the spectral outline of the illusion, but is able to block out the distraction and fight as normal. When you cast this spell, you can choose for it not to affect a number of allies you designate less than or equal to your caster level. ",

All fascinated creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to get or remain within the effect. Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, or the like), each fascinated creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is completely blocked (by an obscuring mist spell, for instance), creatures who can't see them are no longer affected. The spell does not affect sightless creatures.

The spell effect surrounds the subject in a dark, clinging shadow that only it perceives, which blocks all auditory, olfactory, taste, and visual sensations.  In addition, it blocks finely tuned senses of touch such as those that provide a creature with tremorsense.

    "description": "You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower. Shadow conjurations are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength. Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature. Spells that deal damage, such as Melf's acid arrow, have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow conjuration's level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level. In addition, any effect created by shadow conjuration allows spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not. Shadow objects or substances, such as obscuring mist, have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work. A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately). Furthermore, the shadow creature's AC bonuses are one-fifth as large (so a +7 bonus resulting in AC 17 would change to a +1 total bonus for a new AC of 11). A creature that succeeds on its save sees the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell. ",

Your opponent pinwheels its arms as it topples backward into the darkness. \nYou cause the target's shadow to become a temporary gateway to a pocket realm within the Plane of Shadow.  The target must make a Will save or be pulled into the gateway.  Inside the pocket realm, the creature sees a deserted, gloomy duplicate of the real world, while shadowy phantasms stalk and taunt it without causing actual harm.  Each round, the creature can attempt another Will save to return from the shadow well.  Otherwise, the subject returns to the real world when the spell's duration expires. \nBeing trapped in a shadow well can be terrifying; upon returning to the real world, the subject must succeed on another Will save or be frightened for 1d4 rounds. \nUpon leaving the pocket realm, the subject reappears in the spot it had been in when the shadow well spell was cast.  If this spot is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest adjacent empty space. \nSpells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as teleport and dimension door, do not help a creature escape a shadow well spell, although a plane shift spell allows it to flee to another plane as normal.  The target might still become frightened upon leaving. ",
