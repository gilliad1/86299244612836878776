    "description": "An early spell created by Alustriel, this illusion has been circulated among the arcane spellcasters of Silverymoon and to others beyond the city. A simplified form of minor image, it allows you to cause a banner (such as a battle standard, family crest, or other identifying device) to appear anywhere within range, accompanied by musical fanfare or the sound of a horn blowing. The banner may appear large or small (up to 10 feet square), new or old, clean or dirty, and of any color or pattern you desire and bearing any identifying images you desire. The banner sheds light as a light spell. You can move it anywhere within range as a move-equivalent action. The fanfare or horn is normally of the sort announcing the presence of an important person or a military unit, although the spell can create any sort of horn signal. Normally, casters use the spell to rally troops or direct people to a particular location, especially at night when its light aspect becomes more useful. Material Component: A horn or trumpet, whether normal size or miniature. ",

If detect magic or a similar effect is used to detect the presence of magical auras on the object, the caster must succeed on a caster level check (DC 10 + your caster level) to find any magical auras that are the result of active spells.  (The DM should make this roll in secret to prevent subicion by the players. ) A single successful check will reveal both the hidden ward and the spells it hides. \nIn addition, casting this spell on a magic trap (such as a fire trap spell cast on an object) increases the Search DC to find the trap by one-half you caster level (maximum +5).  This spell cannot be used to conceal nonmagical traps, nor does it hide the magical properties of an item that aren't dependent on active spells (such as the magic aura of a +1 longsword). \nSpecial: When cast by a character with any Mark of Warding dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Kundarak), the duration increases to one day per level. \nMaterial Component: Lead shavings and powdered diamond worth 100 gp.

If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), Nystul's magic aura doesn't work.
