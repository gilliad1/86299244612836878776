    "description": "You complete the spell with a few last gestures and arcane words.  You feel a pressure in your mind as you begin to relay the intent of your dreaming contact. \nThis spell functions like dream (PH 225), except as noted above and that you can alter the sleeping person's dreams to produce a specific desired effect.  The dreamer gets a Will saving throw to resist the additional effects of this spell; if the save succeeds, the dream casting spell can send only a message, in the manner of a dream spell.  If the saving throw fails, you decide what additional effect the message carries. \nFear: Your image in the dream is surrounded by intimidating imagery and an aura of power.  For the duration of the spell, any time the dreamer can see you or knows you are present, he is shaken.  This is a compulsion and fear effect. \nCharm: Your image in the dream appears particularly helpful and kind.  For the duration of the spell, the dreamer is under the effect of a charm monster spell.  This is a charm effect. \nRage: Your image in the dream taunts and harasses the dreamer.  For the duration of the spell, any time the dreamer can see you or knows you are present, he preferentially attacks you if in a combat situation.  The dreamer gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls when attacking you while under this effect.  This is a compulsion effect. \nHarrow: Your image in the dream behaves in a bizarre and irrational manner.  For the duration of the spell, the dreamer behaves in an unusual manner, gaining two random traits from Table 4-24: One Hundred traits (DMG 128), rerolling any result not pertinent to behavior.  If the dreamer can see you or knows you are present, he is confused for 1 round/level",

The subject is convinced that the sender of the message is someone other than the caster, as specified by the caster. The caster must be also familiar with the false sender. The subject can answer in like manner immediately. Creatures with Intelligence scores as low as 1 can understand the sending, though a subject's ability to react is limited normally by its Intelligence. Even if the sending is received, the subject creature is not obligated to act upon it in any manner. If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as the caster, there is a 5% chance that the sending does not arrive.

Those that fail their saves fall prone and are unable to take any action except clawing desperately at the floor in the hopes of stopping their apparent fall.  An attack on an affected creature frees it from the effect of the illusion but leaves it stunned for 1 round.  Likewise, when the spell ends, creatures that believed they were falling are stunned for 1 round. Flying creatures passing over an illusory pit are unaffected by the spell. ",

You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so. The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity (for instance, fleeing down a hallway) until the duration expires. The improved invisibility lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration. ",

    "description": "To use the shadow walk spell, you must be in an area of shadowy illumination. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other. In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane. Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10×100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10×1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save). Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours. Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful. ",

    "description": "You feel a spectral force form near you, as if some intangible shadow being stood nearby.  Upon choosing the target of your spell, you sense the shadowy force depart from your side, moving as fast as thought toward the creature you designated as your target.  You see the target creature move as if attacked by an unseen foe. \nUpon casting this spell, you create a shadowy force that automatically grabs the target (PH 156).  The shadowy force immediately attempts to establish a hold on the target with a grapple check bonus equal to the DC of this spell.  If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the grapple check bonus of the shadowy grappler is cut in half.  For example, a sorcerer with a 16 Charisma who casts this spell creates a shadowy grappler with a grapple check bonus of +19 if the target fails its save and +9 if the target makes its save. \nEvery round on your turn, the shadowy grappler makes a grapple check against the target.  Once it has a hold, the shadowy force attempts to pin the target on the following round.  If the grappler establishes a pin, it uses the option to prevent the target from speaking.  The grappler always attempts to maintain a grapple or work toward a pin. \nA shadowy grappler occupies the same square as the target and moves with the target for as long as the spell lasts.  Other creatures cannot join the grapple, either to assist the target or the grappler. \nMaterial Component: A dried squid tentacle. ",
