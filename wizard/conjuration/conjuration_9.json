This spell creates a rectangular rift in the ground. You designate where the rift opens, but it must be in a straight line on relatively level ground. Throughout the spell's duration, any conjuration spells with the evil descriptor that are cast within 60 feet of the rift function at caster level +2. You cannot make the rift open beneath a fixed structure such as a tower, castle wall, or Daern's instant fortress. However, you can make it open underneath a wagon, tent, or similarly mobile object or lightweight structure. Untended objects wholly or partly in squares occupied by the rift fall in, taking 6d6 points of damage from the fall. Any creature standing wholly or partly in the area where the rift opens must succeed on a Reflex saving throw or fall into it as well, taking a like amount of damage. A successful save indicates that the creature avoids falling in by moving to the nearest safe square(s). Anything that falls into the rift is scorched by black fire that deals 6d6 points of fire damage per round and 6d6 points of divine energy damage per round. Energy resistance or immunity does not protect against the divine energy damage. On the second and third rounds of the spell's duration, black fire continues to fill the rift. In addition, the rift sprouts black fiery tentacles that reach out to all creatures within 60 feet of the rift's edge. Such creatures are entitled to a Reflex save each round to avoid the fiery tendrils; a creature that fails its save is lashed for 3d6 points of fire damage and 3d6 points of divine energy damage. At the end of the spell's duration, the rift closes. Anything still trapped inside the rift when it closes plane shifts (as the spell) to a random layer of the Abyss. All that remains of the rift is a permanent scar on the ground where it formed. Material Component: A miniature adamantine and gem-studded pickaxe worth at least 1,000 gp. ",

The rough boundary of the new earth node may enclose a hollow space, an area of solid rock, or a combination of materials. If node genesis is cast on the surface of the earth, at least a portion of the earth node must be contiguous with the natural ground. You have some leeway in determining the initial shape of your earth node's outer boundary—it doesn't have to be a perfect sphere, though no portion of its volume can be less than 3 cubic feet. The newly generated earth node retains its Class 1 status for one year. Thereafter, its diameter increases at a rate of 20 feet per year, until it eventually reaches a diameter equal to 20 feet per caster level you possessed at the time of casting. When the node's diameter reaches the low end of the range for the next higher class (see Table 4-1), its class increases by +1. For example, a Class 1 node becomes Class 2 when its diameter reaches 40 feet, and Class 3 when its diameter reaches 120 feet.

It fades swiftly, but you can now feel a presence, as though the environment itself watched you. With this spell, you grant the particular building or location a permanent \"guardian spirit\". You must task the spirit with a specific purpose, and that purpose must in some manner involve protecting the building or region to which it is attached. The task can be very general (\"Slay any creature who attempts to enter!\") or far more specific (\"Kill any goblin who tries to take the red sword down off the wall\"). The task can't be so specific as to mention the names of individual creatures, or to require unseen knowledge such as alignments or allegiances. Finally, it must be simple enough to clearly convey in one or two sentences. If the triggering event occurs, the genius loci manifests exactly where you cast the spell, taking the form of an elder elemental (choose air, earth, fire, or water when you cast the spell). It immediately attempts to carry out the designated task. Once the spell is complete, you have no special control over the spirit's actions, and if you trigger the manifestation, it attacks you just as it would anyone else. The manifested spirit behaves in all ways as a normal elemental of its kind, within the parameters of the task assigned. If the spirit's manifested form is slain, it is not destroyed and the spell is not broken. However, it can't manifest for 24 hours after being destroyed. The only way to permanently break a genius loci spell is with a miracle,Mordenkainen's disjunction, or wish, or else to permanently defeat the guardian spirit's purpose. If, for instance, the spirit was commanded to prevent a particular item from being destroyed, the destruction of that item renders its existence moot. When not actively involved in protecting its territory or following its task, the spirit shows no sign of its existence. When it manifests, the creature appears to come out of nowhere. Anyone viewing the building or area with detect magic sees an overwhelming aura of conjuration; true seeing reveals the spirit wandering its territory, appearing as a vague, hazy silhouette of the creature it manifests as.

    "description": "Casting a gate spell has two effects.  First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction. \nSecond, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate.  The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you).  It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. \nA gate has a front and a back.  Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not. \nPlanar Travel: As a mode of planar travel, a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect).  Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire.  Travelers need not join hands with you—anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported.  A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel. \nYou could position a gate in a hallway in order to absorb any attack or force coming at you by shunting it to another plane.  Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter. \nYou may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed. \nCalling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect).  By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling.  Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord.  This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures.  This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below). \nIf you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual—for instance, a bearded devil or a ghaele eladrin—you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures.  You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level.  In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level.  A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled.  Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event.  An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous.  An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time. \nA controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you.  Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service.  Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help.  The creature departs at the end of the spell. \nIf you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service.  The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards.  (Some creatures may want their payment in \"livestock\" rather than in coin, which could involve complications).  Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward.  After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. \nFailure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least.  At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you. \nNote: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.  For example, gate is a chaotic and evil spell when you cast it to call a demon. \nXP Cost: 1,000 XP (only for the calling creatures function). ",

    "description": "You create powerful magic in some specially prepared object—a statuette, a jeweled rod, a gem, or the like. This object contains the power to instantly transport its possessor across any distance within the same plane to your abode. Once the item is transmuted, you must give it willingly to a creature and at the same time inform it of a command word to be spoken when the item is used. To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard action). When this is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and carrying (to a maximum of the character's heavy load) are instantly transported to your abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar that is touching the subject). You can alter the spell when casting it so that it transports you to within 10 feet of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word spoken. You will have a general idea of the location and situation of the item possessor at the time the refuge spell is discharged, but once you decide to alter the spell in this fashion, you have no choice whether or not to be transported.
