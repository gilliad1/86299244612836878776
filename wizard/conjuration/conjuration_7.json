The phase door is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. You disappear when you enter the phase door and appear when you exit. If you desire, you can take one other creature (Medium or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. A gem of true seeing or similar magic reveals the presence of a phase door but does not allow its use. A phase door is subject to dispel magic. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a passwall effect. You can allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify. Phase door can be made permanent with a permanency spell. ",

A wall of eyes is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. The caster can double the wall's area by halving itsthickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5. A section of wall brought to 0 hit points is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall, the DC for the Strength check is 15 +2 per inch of thickness.

The castle includes a single main gate and a sally port, a drawbridge, a 30-foot diameter central tower made of blue ice (see page 80), and one additional tower per 6 levels of the caster. The size of the castle is determined by the location of the towers, which enclose an open courtyard. The maximum perimeter of the structure is 20 feet per caster level. In addition, you can place any or all of the following three magical effects in the castle. 1.  Icicle spells in two areas (typically in the gatehouse and in the central tower). Saving Throw: See text. Spell Resistance: No. 2.  Ice slick spells triggered an intruder steps on the tower stairs. Saving Throw: See text. Spell Resistance: No. 3.  Obscuring snow in any corridors or rooms, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures father away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No. The castle can be created around living creatures, and in this case it rises up from the earth and snow around them. It cannot be \"dropped\" onto creatures as an offensive spell. The caster may choose to be lifted onto the roof of the central tower by centering the spell on himself. If the castle is summoned on relatively level ground, a moat of icy water 20 feet wide surrounds the castle. If summoned on sharply sloping ground, an icy crevasse 20 feet wide and 50 feet deep surrounds the castle. The castle melts slowly whenever the temperature rises above freezing; an ice castle takes 1d6 points of damage each round in a place with temperatures above freezing. When struck by fire spells, the castle is damaged normally. The castle has 200 hit points per 5-foot section and a hardness of 0. The central tower is made of blue ice which has 300 hit points per 5-foot section and a hardness of 10 Creatures can hit the castle automatically. Fire, including a fireball spell and red dragon breath, can melt the ice castle, and it deals full damage to the structure (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects).
