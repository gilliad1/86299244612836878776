    "description": "You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. (See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt). The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. (The DM answers all questions with \"yes\", \"no\", \"maybe\", \"never\", \"irrelevant\", or some other one-word answer). You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the sameround. For every two caster levels, you may ask one question. Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease to Intelligence and Charisma, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the entity answering correctly, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to DM changes, the personalities of individual deities, and so on). On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces. ",

    "description": "By touching a nearby source of water—a standing pool, a stream, or even a portion of a larger body of water—you can perceive creatures and objects in contact with the water. You can concentrate to focus flowsight on a given creature. You retain your full visual acuity, including any magical effects, as well as any auditory enhancements you might have. This action makes the subject potentially aware of the magical scrying; on a Will save, it prevents you from learning more about it, and you cannot try again on that subject for 24 hours. However, you can turn your consciousness to another subject in contacted with the water and make a new scrying attempt each round. Arcane Material Component: A piece of limestone. ",

    "description": "You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called \"eyes\") equal to 1d4 + your caster level.  These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell.  Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions. \nWhile the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot.  Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 Hide modifier.  It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings.  An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch. \nWhen you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words.  Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well, so if you know, for example, what a typical merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. \nA sample command: \"Surround me at a range of four hundred feet and return if you spot any dangerous creatures\".  The phrase \"Surround me\" directs the eyes to form an equally spaced, horizontal ring at whatever range you indicate, and then move with you.  As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate.  In the case of this sample command, an eye returns only if it spots a creature you would regard as dangerous.  A \"peasant\" that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn't trigger an eye's return.  Ten eyes can form a ring with a radius of 400 feet and between themselves see everything that crosses the ring. \nAnother sample command: \"Spread out and search the town for Arweth.  Follow him for three minutes, staying out of sight, and then return\".  The phrase \"Spread out\" directs the eyes to move away from you in all directions.  In this case, each eye would separately follow Arweth for three minutes once it spots him. \nOther commands that might be useful include having eyes form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or having them follow a certain type of creature.  The DM is the final judge of the suitability of your directions. \nIn order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand.  Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence.  It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images.  After relaying its findings, an eye disappears. \nIf an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist.  However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event. \nThe eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you.  Dispel magic can destroy eyes.  Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel.  Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself. \nMaterial Component: A handful of crystal marbles. ",

    "description": "You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing creatures, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another). If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting. Rary's telepathic bond can be made permanent with a permanency spell, though it only bonds two creatures per casting of permanency. Material Component: Pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures. ",
