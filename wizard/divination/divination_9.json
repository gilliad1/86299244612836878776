    "description": "The rigorous ritual of the spell finally draws to a close.  You breathe a sigh of relief even as phantom images appear before your eyes, moving in reverse.  Suddenly they cease their movements and seem more real.  You watch as the phantom images play out their parts in quick succession, showing you the knowledge of the past you seek. \nYou can see and hear into the past, getting a look at events that happened previously at your current location.  The level of detail you see and hear by means of this spell depends on the span of time you wish to observe; concentrating on a span of days renders a more detailed perspective than a span of centuries, for example.  You can view only one span of time per casting, chosen from the following options:\nDays: You sense the events of the past, stretching back one day per caster level.  You gain detailed knowledge of the people, conversations, and events that transpired. \nWeeks: You gain a summary of the events of the past, stretching back one week per caster level.  Exact wording and details are lost, but you know all the participants and the highlights of the conversations and events that took place. \nYears: You gain a general idea of the events of the past, stretching back one year per caster level.  You notice only noteworthy events such as deaths, battles, scenes of great emotion, important discoveries, and significant happenings. \nCenturies: You gain a general idea of the events of the past, stretching back one century plus an additional century for every four caster levels beyond 1st.  For instance, a 16th-level caster would gain insight into the events of four centuries in the past, and a 17th-level caster would see back across five centuries.  You notice only the most remarkable of events: coronations, deaths of important personages, major battles, and other truly historic happenings. \nMaterial Component: An hourglass-shaped diamond worth at least 1,000 gp.

    "description": "This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once foresight is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. Thus, if you are the subject of the spell, you would be warned in advance if a rogue were about to attempt a sneak attack on you, or if a creature were about to leap out from a hiding place, or if an attacker were specifically targeting you with a spell or ranged weapon. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself—duck, jump right, close your eyes, and so on—and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC. When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Arcane Material Component: A hummingbird's feather. ",

    "description": "Your invocation creates a miniature floating eye of faintly glowing blue energy.  Spying your enemy from the safety of your magical sensor, you unleash your spell. \nThis spell functions like arcane eye (PH 200), except as noted here.  You can cast any spell of 3rd level or lower that has a range other tan personal through the eye.  Any spell so cast functions as though it had been cast from the eye's location rather than yours.  Casting any spell of higher than 3rd level through the eye not only produces no effect (though the spell is still expended), but it destroys the eye of power and ends the spell. \nUnlike an arcane eye, an eye of power is visible and corporeal, so it can be destroyed.  The eye is a Fine object with AC 18 and 77 hit points.  It usues your save bonuses for saving throws. \nMaterial Component: A bit of bat fur. ",
