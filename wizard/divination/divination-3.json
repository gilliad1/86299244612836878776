As an immediate action, the target creature can activate the adept spirit.

The adept spirit remains active for 1 minute, and then its power is expended and the spell ends. No creature can be the target of more than one adept spirit spell simultaneously. If a second is cast before the first has been discharged, the second spell dissipates to no effect. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in this spell, the bonus on Will saves, Concentration checks, Intelligence checks, and Intelligence-based skill checks provided by the spirit improves by 1.

The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly. You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect magic spell (page 219). If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect). If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use. In some cases, arcane sight may give a deceptively low reading—for example, when you use it on a spellcaster who has used up most of his or her daily spell allotment. Arcane sight can be made permanent with a permanency spell. ",

The spell will detect everything from a vein of iron ore to a pile of gold coins, even through solid stone or other barriers. When you cast this spell, you must concentrate on at least 10 pounds of the metal or mineral you're searching for. If an accumulation of that metal 10 pounds or larger is within the spell area, you will unerringly sense it (most coins are 50 to the pound). The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area:1st Round: Presence or absence of the particular metal or mineral. 2nd Round: Approximate weight of the metal or mineral. 3rd Round: Distance and direction (measured in a straight line) to the metal or mineral. As long as the spell is active, you can change the metal or mineral you're trying to detect by simply concentrating on a different sample (it takes a standard action to refocus on the new sample). Thus you could search for gold, then switch to adamantine, then seek out sources of iron. If you stop concentrating on a sample, the spell ends. If your sample is unworked, you will detect only unworked accumulations of the metal, such as ore deposits and mineral veins. You will only detect worked metal, such as gold coins or mithral armor, if your sample is likewise refined. Note: Each round you can turn to detect things in a new area.
