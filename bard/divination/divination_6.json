    "description": "The rigorous ritual of the spell finally draws to a close.  You breathe a sigh of relief even as phantom images appear before your eyes, moving in reverse.  Suddenly they cease their movements and seem more real.  You watch as the phantom images play out their parts in quick succession, showing you the knowledge of the past you seek. \nYou can see and hear into the past, getting a look at events that happened previously at your current location.  The level of detail you see and hear by means of this spell depends on the span of time you wish to observe; concentrating on a span of days renders a more detailed perspective than a span of centuries, for example.  You can view only one span of time per casting, chosen from the following options:\nDays: You sense the events of the past, stretching back one day per caster level.  You gain detailed knowledge of the people, conversations, and events that transpired. \nWeeks: You gain a summary of the events of the past, stretching back one week per caster level.  Exact wording and details are lost, but you know all the participants and the highlights of the conversations and events that took place. \nYears: You gain a general idea of the events of the past, stretching back one year per caster level.  You notice only noteworthy events such as deaths, battles, scenes of great emotion, important discoveries, and significant happenings. \nCenturies: You gain a general idea of the events of the past, stretching back one century plus an additional century for every four caster levels beyond 1st.  For instance, a 16th-level caster would gain insight into the events of four centuries in the past, and a 17th-level caster would see back across five centuries.  You notice only the most remarkable of events: coronations, deaths of important personages, major battles, and other truly historic happenings. \nMaterial Component: An hourglass-shaped diamond worth at least 1,000 gp.

Each round, you may examine a single creature or object that you can see as a free action.  In the case of a magic item, you learn its functions, how to activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if it uses charges).  In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level. \nAn attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires.  If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it.  An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other analyze dweomer spells for 24 hours. \nAnalyze dweomer does not function when used on an artifact (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on artifacts). \nFocus: A tiny lens of ruby or sapphire set in a small golden loop.

You gain a +1 insight bonus to Armor Class and a +1 insight bonus on saving throws for the duration of the spell. \nOnce during the spell's duration, you can gain an insight bonus equal to one-half your caster level (maximum +10) on any saving throw.  Activating this effect is an immediate action, but it must be done before you make the roll to be modified.  Once this ability is used, the spell ends. \nIf you have the Dragon Prophesier feat (see page 46), you can enter a state of prophetic favor as an immediate action instead of a full-round action while this spell is in effect.
