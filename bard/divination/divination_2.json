At the end, you know that the creature you seek lies in the direction you face. \nYou divine the relative direction and condition of another creature.  You must have firsthand knowledge of the creature for the spell to function. \nIf the creature is alive and on the same plane as you, the spell leaves you facing in its direction.  You also get an impression of its physical and emotional condition (unharmed, wounded, unconscious, dying, and so on).  If the creature you seek is on a different plane or dead, you feel nothing. ",

Each rune identifies a particular vulnerability or resistanceâ€”red for resistances, green for vulnerabilities. \nYou learn any special qualities, vulnerabilities, and resistances the target creature has.  Vulnerabilities include anything that causes the creature more than the normal amount of damage (such as a creature with the cold subtype having vulnerability to fire or a crystalline creature's susceptibility to the shatter spell).  Resistances include any effects that reduce or negate damage the creature takes and immunities to particular attacks.  The spell identifies resistances and vulnerabilities granted by spell effects. \nFor example, if cast upon a balor, you learn that it has damage reduction 15/cold iron and good; spell resistance 28; immunity to poison, fire, and electricity; resistance to acid 10 and cold 10; and that it does not have any particular vulnerabilities.
