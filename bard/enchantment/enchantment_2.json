The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions. \nUsing some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you.  It advances and awaits your bidding.  You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark (such as the peak of a distant mountain).  The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own.  You can attach some small item or note to the messenger.  The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities. \nDuring this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries.  Unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a bird or other small animal, the carrier may be ignored.  The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a language he or she doesn't know, for example). \nMaterial Component: A morsel of food the animal likes.

The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a noble knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets.

    "description": "From your outstretched hand leaps forth a ray of glittering energy apparently composed of countless minuscule writhing insects.  The hum of minute chitinous bodies scrambling over one another fills the air. \nYou must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.  When this ray successfully strikes, it creates a sensation of many tiny insects biting and crawling on the victim's body.  The target can attempt a Will save each round to shake off the effect.  Until the spell is shrugged off, the victim is hampered by the unsettling feeling of all the stinging and biting, and is able to perform only a single move or standard action each round.  The victim also takes a -2 penalty to AC.  In addition, if the victim attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a Concentration check with a DC equal to the sting ray's DC + the level of the spell the subject is attempting to cast.  For example, if a 6th-level sorcerer with a Charisma score of 16 casts sting ray on a wizard casting a fireball, the Concentration check DC is 19 (16 [sting ray DC] + 3 [fireball spell level]). \nA successful Will save negates the effect restricting the subject's action to one move or one standard action each round, nor does the subject need to make a Concentration check each time it wishes to cast a spell.  However, the subject still takes the penalty to AC for the duration of the spell with a successful save. \nMaterial Component: Four dried stinging insects (bees, wasps, and so on). ",
