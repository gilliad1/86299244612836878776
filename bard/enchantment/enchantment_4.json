Although it is typically used only as a last resort when nonmagical negotiating (or blackmail) fails, the insidious suggestion spell comprises a powerful part of gnome negotiating strategy. \nWhen you cast this spell, it functions just like a suggestion spell (page 285 of the Player's Handbook), except that if the target makes its saving throw, the same suggestion is repeated on your turn in each subsequent round (maximum 1 round per caster level).  The target creature must make another saving throw each round or be affected by the suggestion, acting out the specified course of action for up to 1 hour per caster level or until the action is completed (as per the suggestion spell). \nSpecial: Gnome spellcasters cast this spell at +1 caster level. \nMindset: The energies you manipulate while preparing this spell enhance your force of personality, granting you a +2 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.

    "description": "You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways. \n\nEliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced.  This spell cannot negate charm, geas/quest, suggestion, or similar spells. \nAllow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually experienced. \n\nFor instance, it could recall every word from a 5-minute conversation or every detail from a passage in a book.  \n\nChange the details of an event the subject actually experienced. \nImplant a memory of an event the subject never experienced. \nCasting the spell takes 1 round.  If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory time you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject.  If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost. \nA modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural inclinations.  An illogical modified memory, such as the subject recalling how much it enjoyed drinking poison, is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine. \nMore useful applications of modify memory include implanting memories of friendly encounters with you (inclining the subject to act favorably toward you), changing the details of orders given to the subject by a superior, or causing the subject to forget that it ever saw you or your party. \nThe DM reserves the right to decide whether a modified memory is too nonsensical to significantly affect the subject.

    "description": "You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind. If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as \"Come here\", \"Go there\", \"Fight\", and \"Stand still\". You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description, page 81). Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action. By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth). Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it. If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination. Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it.
