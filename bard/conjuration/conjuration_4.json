    "description": "You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast—stone, timber, or (at worst) sod. The floor is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace. The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise—it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants). The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being arcane locked and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell. Finally, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter. The secure shelter contains rude furnishings—eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk. Material Component: A square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood. These must be augmented by the components of the unseen servant spell (string and a bit of wood) if this benefit is to be included. Focus: The focus of the alarm spell (silver wire and a tiny bell) if this benefit is to be included. ",

    "description": "With a faint shimmering and a rushing breeze, an ornate carriage appears on the street, pulled by four snorting, faintly translucent horses. You conjure up a carriage capable of seating four passengers comfortably or six in cramped conditions, as well as the horses needed to pull it. These \"horses\" are similar to those created by the phantom steed spell, though they do not gain any of the special, level-based abilities conferred by that spell. They respond to your thoughts alone, and they can pull the carriage at a speed of up to 50 feet. The carriage resists flames as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants). The interior contains lush, cushioned seats. The side windows can be opened to allow for missile fire or spellcasting. If the windows are open, everyone inside is considered to have cover. but they are not impervious to missiles as they would otherwise be.

You always arrive at exactly the spot desired—whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction, such as \"900 feet straight downward\", or \"upward to the northwest, 45-degree angle, 1,200 feet\".  After using this spell, you can't take any other actions until your next turn.  You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load.  You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels.  A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.  All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. \nIf you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. \nIf there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet.

The mounts appear as horses or any other commonly ridden mounts, but they have a foggy, almost translucent nature, and their colors shift acroos the spectrum over time. \nThese mounts have AC 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex), and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level.  They do not fight and have no attacks.
