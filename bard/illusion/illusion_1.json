Though the subject doesn't actually perceive any additional enemies (and thus doesn't waste any attacks on the phantasm), a creature affected by this spell is considered flanked, even if not threatened by other creatures.  No amount of convincing by others can help the subject of this spell avoid its effectâ€”only a successful saving throw against the spell when initially cast can help the target.  A creature that can't be flanked is immune to this spell. ",

    "description": "An early spell created by Alustriel, this illusion has been circulated among the arcane spellcasters of Silverymoon and to others beyond the city. A simplified form of minor image, it allows you to cause a banner (such as a battle standard, family crest, or other identifying device) to appear anywhere within range, accompanied by musical fanfare or the sound of a horn blowing. The banner may appear large or small (up to 10 feet square), new or old, clean or dirty, and of any color or pattern you desire and bearing any identifying images you desire. The banner sheds light as a light spell. You can move it anywhere within range as a move-equivalent action. The fanfare or horn is normally of the sort announcing the presence of an important person or a military unit, although the spell can create any sort of horn signal. Normally, casters use the spell to rally troops or direct people to a particular location, especially at night when its light aspect becomes more useful. Material Component: A horn or trumpet, whether normal size or miniature. ",

You choose what your ambient song sounds like, but it should be a noise that's in harmony with the immediate environment. A subject who makes a successful Will save realizes that the sound has been altered and can hear its true nature.

    "description": "This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: \"Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack sits cross-legged within a distance of one foot\". Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, metal clanking) or to a specific noise or spoken word (when a pin drops, or when anyone says \"Boo\"). Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. For example, \"Speak when any creature touches the statue\"is an acceptable command if the creature is visible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance. Magic mouth can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
