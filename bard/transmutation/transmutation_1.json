You do not gain any of the spell-like abilities of the true dragonmark, but you are treated as having that particular dragonmark for the purpose of being able to cast spells or use magic items that require you to have a mark of that type.  You can continue to use your aberrant dragonmark spell-like abilities as normal. \nIf you have a base aberrant dragonmark, you can reshape it into the form of any least true dragonmark.  If you have a lesser or greater aberrant dragonmark, you can reshape it into a lesser or greater true dragonmark, respectively. \nThis spell taxes the body.  At the end of the spell's duration, you are nauseated for 1d10 rounds. \nDragonmark: Any aberrant dragonmark. ",

    "description": "The affected creatures or objects fall slowly, though faster than feathers typically do. Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of afall froma few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes. The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth. You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell when it isn't your turn. This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, such as a boulder dropped from the top of a castle wall, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop. (See the Dungeon Master's Guide for information on falling objects). Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature. ",

Jagged edges and rough surfaces break forth all over the target creature's armor and shield. These protrusions deal no damage and are little more than an uncomfortable annoyance. Arcane spellcasters, however, find the effect most distracting, incurring double the normal arcane spell failure chance for armor and shields. In addition, any creature affected by this spell takes a -5 penalty on Concentration checks. The check penalty does not worsen if an affected creature is both wearing armor and using a shield. For example, a wizard wearing chainmail and carrying a light steel shield would normally have a 35% chance of arcane spell failure. That wizard, if targeted by this spell, would incur a 70% chance of arcane spell failure, as well as taking a -5 penalty on Concentration checks.

You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell. \nThe rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it—it does not snake outward—so it must be thrown near the intended target.  Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet).  A typical 1-inchdiameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it.  The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled.
