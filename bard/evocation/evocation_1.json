    "description": "This spell causes an object to radiate distracting shadows in a 10-foot-radius spread.  Casual scrutiny of an affected area doesn't reveal anything out of the ordinary; however, cracks, crannies, corners, hidden traps, and secret entrances or exits within the area become harder to spot. \nCreatures within the area or looking into it are subliminally confused by the distracting shadows, and take a -5 penalty on all Spot and Search checks.  However, the shadows do not provide sufficient concealment for a creature to make a Hide check. \nDistracting shadows counters or dispels any light or darkness spell of equal or lower level. \nDistracting shadows can be made permanent with a permanency spell (minimum caster level 10th; cost 1,000 XP). \nSpecial: A character with any Mark of Shadow dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Phiarlan or Thuranni), can cast this spell to fill a 20-foot-radius spread. \nMaterial Component: A bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch or a piece of coal.
