Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). An affected creature is allowed a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half, and a creature holding fragile objects can negate damage to them with a successful Reflex save.

A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the deafened effect. The clamorous sound in the area also interferes with all sonic spells and effects.

The dome shakes and rattles, while the muffled sounds of explosive blasts echoes from it. Any creature within the dome is knocked into the air by the powerful, ear-splitting blasts. This spell creates an area of turbulent, sonic energy. For the duration of the spell, any creature that starts its turn in the spell's area must make a Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of sonic damage. In addition, affected creatures must make a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature is already prone, failing this save has no effect on it. ",
