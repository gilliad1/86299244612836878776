    "description": "Shatter creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle, nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature. Used as an area attack, shatter destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain, such as vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, windows, mirrors, and so forth. All such objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered. Alternatively, you can target shatter against a single solid object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), shatter deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage. Arcane Material Component: A chip of mica. ",

    "description": "A ray of pulsing yellow light springs from your hand. It strikes your target and wraps around him like a snake, hampering his ability to move and attack. This spell creates a ropey strand of arcane energy that restricts a creature's movements. A creature struck by this ray can only make one attack per round and cannot make attacks of opportunity. In addition, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet. After the spell has been in effect for 1 round, at the start of its turn in each round thereafter, the subject is allowed a Reflex save to resist the spell's effects. If the save succeeds, the creature ignores the spell's effects for that round. It must make a new save each round, regardless of the result of a previous save. ",

    "description": "This spell causes an object to radiate shadowy illumination out to a 20-foot radius. All creatures in the area gain concealment (20% miss chance). Even creatures that can normally see in such conditions (such as with darkvision or lowlight vision) have the miss chance in an area shrouded in magical darkness. Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) are incapable of brightening the area, as are light spells of lower level (such as light or dancing lights). Higher level light spells (such as daylight) are not affected by darkness. If darkness is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed. Darkness counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower spell level. Arcane Material Component: A bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch or a piece of coal. ",
