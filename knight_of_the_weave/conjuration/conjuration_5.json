    "description": "You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range.  You always arrive at exactly the spot desiredâ€”whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction, such as \"900 feet straight downward\", or \"upward to the northwest, 45-degree angle, 1,200 feet\".  After using this spell, you can't take any other actions until your next turn.  You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load.  You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels.  A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.  All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. \nIf you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. \nIf there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet.  If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you and each creature travelling with you take an additional 4d6 points of damage and the spell simply fails. ",

    "description": "You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move). The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking). The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions. If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of piercing damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature. The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder's turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled. The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends. Material Component: A tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread. ",
