    "description": "You may transfer your own hit points directly to a target creature within range. You must transfer at least 20 points. Transferred hit points are damage to you. The creature takes your transferred hit points as if receiving a cure wounds spell and cannot gain more hit points than its maximum allows; any excess points are lost. This spell transfers only actual hit points, not temporary hit points. An unconscious target is considered a \"willing creature\" for purposes of this spell. ",
