    "description": "This spell functions like locate object, except this spell locates a known or familiar creature. You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within range. You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any. The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn) or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of a certain type (such as humanoid or animal). To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once. Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by mislead, nondetection, and polymorph spells. Material Component: A bit of fur from a bloodhound. ",

    "description": "You can see and hear some creature, which may be at any distance.  If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the scrying attempt simply fails.  The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.  Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save. \n\n\nKnowledge \nWill Save Modifier \n\n\n None 1 \n +10 \n\n\n Secondhand (you have heard of the subject) \n +5 \n\n\n Firsthand (you have met the subject) \n +0 \n\n\n Familiar (you know the subject well) \n —5 \n\n\n1 You must have some sort of connection to a creature you have no knowledge of.  \n\n\nConnection \nWill Save Modifier \n\n\n Likeness or picture \n —2 \n\n\n Possession or garment \n —4 \n\n\n Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc.  \n —10 \n\n\nIf the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and the subject's immediate surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject).  If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet. \nAs with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects.  In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, and message.  \nIf the save succeeds, you can't attempt to scry on that subject again for at least 24 hours. \nArcane Material Component: The eye of a hawk, an eagle, or a roc, plus nitric acid, copper, and zinc. \nWizard, Sorcerer, or Bard Focus: A mirror of finely wrought and highly polished silver costing not less than 1,000 gp.  The mirror must be at least 2 feet by 4 feet. \nCleric Focus: A holy water font costing not less than 100 gp. \nDruid Focus: A natural pool of water. ",

    "description": "Legend lore brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4×10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are \"legendary\", as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds. Examples of legend lore results include the following. A divination about a mysterious magic axe you have at hand: \"Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft chops the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Son or Daughter of Stone, one who loves Moradin and whom Moradin loves, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word 'Rudnogg'on the lips\". A divination about a legendary paladin about whom you know many details: \"Vanashon has been denied the glory of death and the duty of life. He waits patiently beneath the Forbidden Mountain\". (The paladin has been turned to stone in the caverns under the mountain). A divination about ancient ruins about which you have only a passing reference in a partially damaged tome: \"The sorcerer who called herself Ryth built a library without words and a temple without gods. Those who read and those who pray tore it down in a night and a day\". (These clues may be enough for you to find out more and get details you need to cast a better legend lore). Material Component: Incense worth at least 250 gp. Focus: Four strips of ivory (worth 50 gp each) formed into a rectangle. ",
