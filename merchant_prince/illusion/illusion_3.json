You can affect 10 cubic inches of metal—the equivalent of about 150 coins or 3 pounds—per level.  If you want to affect multiple objects, such as a chest full of coins, you only need to touch one of the objects, providing that all of the other objects to be affected are in contact with one another. \nMaterial Component: A powdered gem of at least 5 gp in value sprinkled over the object(s).
