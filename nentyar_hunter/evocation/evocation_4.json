    "description": "One or more globes of force about 3 inches across streak from your palm at their targets. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The orbs deal a total of 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), divided any way you see fit, but a single orb must deal at least 1d6 points of damage. You declare the division of damage between targets before making your attack rolls. A creature struck directly takes the orb's damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces damage by half. If you miss, the orb explodes in a 10-foot burst, dealing 2 points per die of damage assigned to that orb. A successful Reflex save reduces the burst damage by half. ",
