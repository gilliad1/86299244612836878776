    "description": "This spell functions like magic weapon, except that it gives a weapon an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). \nAlternatively, you can affect as many as fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets.  The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container).  Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation when used.  (Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell). \nArcane Material Component: Powdered lime and carbon. ",
